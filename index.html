Written to engage the teenage mind, but also instructive for the rest of us, we discover that the feasts of Israel are rich with prophecy and present day application. Proof of this book&#x2019;s relevance is that Donna has taught its contents to many teenagers who, for the first time, see the Old Testament not as an ancient narrative, but a life-changing account of God&#x2019;s intervention into human history. Read it, learn from it and recommend it to your friends.&#x201d; DR. ERWIN LUTZER, SENIOR PASTOR, MOODY CHURCH &#x201c;Some years ago my wife and I&#x2014;both Jewish believers in the Messiah&#x2014;wrote a book entitled the Fall Feasts of Israel to try and explain these three great biblical festivals to both Christians and Jewish people. It was our hope to help the reader understand the festival and discover the fulfillment of the festivals in Jesus the Messiah. Our book was geared towards adults but it was always my hope that someone would write a book relating these magnificent truths to young people. Donna Baer has now written this book and it is my pleasure to recommend The Bible's Feasts to you and especially to Christian teenagers. I also believe The Bible's Feasts will be helpful to young people who have not yet accepted Jesus as their Messiah and are seeking spiritual solutions to the everyday challenges they face.&#x201d; DR. MITCH GLASER, PRESIDENT, CHOSEN PEOPLE MINISTRIES A book for curious souls. Click the ADD TO CART button to order now.</p><p>Donna Baer is an Ivy League educated investment banker, turned homeschooling mother of ten. Her desire to write this book came out of her decades of experience as a church youth group leader. Year after year, teenagers who were curious about the Bible or had serious questions about their faith would ask her for book recommendations. Most of the best sellers in the YA categories were either too light, or too laden with pathologies for her to endorse. She wanted to provide an option for young adults that spoke clearly, narrated well, and respected their intelligence. When the author shared the contents of this book with teenage girls on Friday nights, dozens would sit attentively as she taught hour-long sessions. Without texting or fidgeting (and without the lure of the opposite sex!), these young adults were captivated by the story of Christ hidden in the Bible&#39;s Feasts. Though the book was originally intended for a teenage audience, many adults have profited from its clean, jargon-free descriptions of the Christian faith. This book is perfect for theological novices-- of all ages.</p><h2>Little Men</h2><p>Louisa May Alcott&#39;s classic story about young boys growing up in nineteenth-century New England</p><p><p>Jo March, the tomboy heroine of <i>Little Women,</i> has grown up! She returns in this beloved sequel as a young woman with a family of her own. Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, open their hearts (and their home) to educate and care for a handful of rowdy yet well-meaning youngsters.<br>Plumfield, the school where the boys learn "how to help themselves and be useful men," has a spirited student body that includes&#x2014;in addition to the Bhaers' two sons&#x2014;Nat, an orphaned street musician, cold and frightened when he first appears at the Bhaers' door; business-minded Tommy; Dan, a "wild boy" eventually tamed by love and kindness; and other endearing little mischief-makers.<br>Outside the classroom, the boys rush headlong from one prank to another&#x2014;from playing matador with the family cow to nearly setting the school afire with a smoldering cigar stub. But in the end, they prove to have a positive effect on the lives of the entire Bhaer family.</p><p></p>Louisa May Alcott was both an abolitionist and a feminist. She is best known for Little Women (1868), a semiautobiographical account of her childhood years with her sisters in Concord, Massachusetts. Alcott, unlike Jo, never married: &#34;&#34;...because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.&#34;&#34; She was an advocate of women&#39;s suffrage and was the first woman to register to vote in Concord, Massachusetts.</p><h2>More Than a Carpenter</h2><p>If you are trying to find a simple, easy to read case for the claims of Jesus Christ as the Son of God, Josh McDowell&#39;s &#34;More Than A Carpenter&#34; is what you&#39;ve been looking for. It is not a powerful apologetic or a theological masterpiece but it is a great introduction into the study of who Jesus Christ really is. The foundation of the book is based on the three primary possibilities for who Christ is; Lord, liar or lunatic. This is backed up with a defense of the reliability of the Scriptures, an argument from changed lives over history and an argument for Christ&#39;s resurrection</p><p></p><h2>What Can We Learn from the Christ Child?: An Advent Study for Adults</h2><p>Readers are better prepared to experience and share the joy of Christmas when they allow themselves to learn from the Christmas story.

Thanks to this edition, Latin-less readers will be better placed than ever to see why this undisputed milestone in the intellectual life of medieval France is also a masterpiece of Western literature.</p><p>In addition to the <i>The Calamities</i> and the letters--the first complete English translation of all seven in more than eighty years--this volume includes an Introduction, a map, and a chronology, Abelard's <i>Confession of Faith</i>, letters between Heloise and Peter the Venerable, the Introduction to <i>The Questions of Heloise</i>, and selected songs and poems by Abelard, among them a previously untranslated shaped poem, Open Wide Your Eyes.

A beautiful patchwork representation of the dahlia flower, this classic quilt was often judged too difficult for anyone but the most experienced quilter. Noted quilting teachers and authors Susan Murwin and Suzzy Payne rediscovered the Giant Dahlia in the late 1970s and determined to make it accessible to quilters of every degree of skill.

The Church is not just an organization to which we belong; it is an organization of which we are a part. Loyalty to the Church is not merely one among many loyalties. It is the one great loyalty of our lives in which all other loyalties are rooted and from which all derive their life and strength. For the Church is Christ and in the Church we are united with Him and with one another as members of one Body. Hence, a burning love for the Church must always be an outstanding characteristic of a good Catholic. <br><br> <b>THE STORY OF THE CHURCH </b>has been written for boys and girls with the hope that, as they learn from the story that it tells, their love of Christ in His Church will increase and that a lifelong interest in Church History will be enkindled. As much as possible we have tried to weave our story around the great men and women who in every age have labored heroically for the spread of the Kingdom of Christ and who have won for themselves the most glorious title that can be given to a human being, the title of Saint. Christ lived in them and through them revealed to the world the power and the beauty of His Gospel. <i>(From the Author s Preface.)</i> <br><br> Originally published in 1935 and reprinted many times. A famous textbook in Church history woven around the lives of the famous; influential saints who labored heroically in every age to spread the Kingdom of Christ. 7th through 12th grade level.

Chen draws on recent debates about sexuality, race, and affect to examine how matter that is considered insensate, immobile, or deathly animates cultural lives. Toward that end, Chen investigates the blurry division between the living and the dead, or that which is beyond the human or animal. Within the field of linguistics, animacy has been described variously as a quality of agency, awareness, mobility, sentience, or liveness. Chen turns to cognitive linguistics to stress how language habitually differentiates the animate and the inanimate. Expanding this construct, Chen argues that animacy undergirds much that is pressing and indeed volatile in contemporary culture, from animal rights debates to biosecurity concerns. <p></p><p>Chen's book is the first to bring the concept of animacy together with queer of color scholarship, critical animal studies, and disability theory. Through analyses of dehumanizing insults, the meanings of queerness, animal protagonists in recent Asian/American art and film, the lead in toys panic in 2007, and the social lives of environmental illness, <i>Animacies</i> illuminates a hierarchical politics infused by race, sexuality, and ability. In this groundbreaking book, Chen rethinks the criteria governing agency and receptivity, health and toxicity, productivity and stillness&#x2014;and demonstrates how attention to the affective charge of matter challenges commonsense orderings of the world.</p></p><p>Mel Y. Chen is Assistant Professor of Gender and Women&#39;s Studies at the University of California, Berkeley."<i>Animacies</i> is a book about 'reworldings,' as Mel Y. Chen traces the myriad ways that objects and affects move through and reshape zones of possibility for political transformation and queer resistance to neoliberal biopolitics. At the same time, <i>Animacies</i> itself generates such transformations: grounded in a generous, expansive understanding of queer of color and disability/crip critique, Chen's study reworlds or reorients disability studies, gender and sexuality studies, critical race theory, animal studies, affect studies, and linguistics. In all of these critical spaces, <i>Animacies</i> might be described as the breathtaking and revivifying book we have been waiting for." (Robert McRuer, author of <i>Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability</i>)<br><br>"This ambitious transdisciplinary analysis of the relations between humans, nonhuman animals, and matter charts a compelling and innovative rethinking of the biopolitics of 'animacy.' Mel Y. Chen <i>animates</i> animacy, a concept of sentience hierarchy derived in linguistics, to offer a far-ranging critique that implicates disability studies, queer of color critique, and postcolonial theory. The generative result is a timely and crucial intervention that foregrounds the oft-occluded import of race and sex in the rapidly growing fields of posthumanist theory, new materialisms, and animal studies." (Jasbir K. Puar, author of <i>Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer Times</i>)</p><h2>Comet&#39;s Nine Lives</h2><p>Like all cats, Comet knew he had been born with nine lives. But he'd never thought much about it until the day he lost life number one in a flower garden on Nantucket. He'd spent lazy days wandering all over the island, not calling any one place home. Now he knows it is time to settle down. But Comet's lives begin to disappear all too quickly, as he gets into one humorous predicament after another. Then comes the day of the big hurricane....<br><br>Beautiful island scenes--sandy beaches, hillside flower gardens, seaside trails, villages, and the sea itself are set within exquisite shell borders. Once again Jan Brett brings her originality and charm to a familiar setting as she inhabits her Nantucket with colorful canine residents, among them a shaggy sheepdog captain who travels through the story and into the borders looking for a friend to live with him and his lighthouse cat.</p><p>With over thirty four million books in print, Jan Brett is one of the nation's foremost author illustrators of children's books. Jan lives in a seacoast town in Massachusetts, close to where she grew up. During the summer her family moves to a home in the Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts.<p>As a child, Jan Brett decided to be an illustrator and spent many hours reading and drawing. She says, "I remember the special quiet of rainy days when I felt that I could enter the pages of my beautiful picture books. Now I try to recreate that feeling of believing that the imaginary place I'm drawing really exists. The detail in my work helps to convince me, and I hope others as well, that such places might be real."</p><p>As a student at the Boston Museum School, she spent hours in the Museum of Fine Arts. "It was overwhelming to see the room-size landscapes and towering stone sculptures, and then moments later to refocus on delicately embroidered kimonos and ancient porcelain," she says. "I'm delighted and surprised when fragments of these beautiful images come back to me in my painting."</p><p>Travel is also a constant inspiration. Together with her husband, Joe Hearne, who is a member of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Jan visits many different countries where she researches the architecture and costumes that appear in her work. "From cave paintings to Norwegian sleighs, to Japanese gardens, I study the traditions of the many countries I visit and use them as a starting point for my children's books."</p>Brett (The Mitten; Armadillo Rodeo), a Massachusetts resident, stays close to home with this latest book, setting it on Nantucket. Capturing the island's rustic charm, her characteristically bustling, elaborately bordered art showcases weathered shingle buildings, a gray-blue sea and shell-sprinkled beaches. Comet, the protagonist, appears to be just about the sole feline in a Nantucket otherwise populated by nattily dressed canines. In search of a home?as well as adventure?the roaming cat meets with peril. Snoozing in a bookstore, he is buried under a pile of books; taking a ride on a scallop boat, he's swept overboard by a huge wave; visiting an ice cream shop, he falls headfirst into a milkshake. Though some of these scenarios have comic potential, all eight of them prove fatal to poor Comet, whose ghostlike, winged image is in each case seen fleeing the scene.

She empowers readers to think about their stuff and the environment in a new way, helping them make more informed choices when it comes to the future of our world.<br><br> Most importantly, this is a book about the power we have as voters and consumers to make sure that the fight against climate change includes all of us and all of our stuff, not just industry groups and politicians. If we have any hope of solving the problem, we all have to do it together.<br></p><p><b>Tatiana Schlossberg </b>is a journalist writing about climate change and the environment.

This event is decisive in Bellori&#x2019;s life, and he thereafter devotes himself to the pursuit and study of angels, the intermediaries of the divine. Beginning in the Garden of Eden and soaring through to the present, A Time for Everything reimagines pivotal encounters between humans and angels: the glow of the cherubim watching over Eden; the profound love between Cain and Abel despite their differences; Lot&#x2019;s shame in Sodom; Noah&#x2019;s isolation before the flood; Ezekiel tied to his bed, prophesying ferociously; the death of Christ; and the emergence of sensual, mischievous cherubs in the seventeenth century. Alighting upon these dramatic scenes &#x2013; from the Bible and beyond &#x2013; Knausgaard&#x2019;s imagination takes flight: the result is a dazzling display of storytelling at its majestic, spellbinding best. Incorporating and challenging tradition, legend, and the Apocrypha, these penetrating glimpses hazard chilling questions: can the nature of the divine undergo change, and can the immortal perish?</p><p>Karl O. Knausgaard was born in Norway in 1968 and made his debut with the novel Ute av verden (Out of the World). A Time for Everything, his second novel, was nominated for the Nordic Council Prize. It is his first to be translated into English. <br><br>James Anderson&#x2019;s literary translations from the Norwegian include Berlin Poplars by Anne B. Ragde, Nutmeg by Kristin Valla, and several works by Jostein Gaarder.Antinous had been born in 1551 at Ardo, a small mountain town in the far north of Italy, where in all likelihood he remained until he began to study in 1565. Apart from one particular event, to which he was to return time after time for the rest of his life, little is known about his early years. The names of his parents and native town do not figure anywhere in Antinous&#x2019;s writings, and, as they are otherwise characterized by a large amount of biographical detail, this early obscurity has aroused the curiosity of many readers. But if one is to attempt to understand Antinous, it isn&#x2019;t to the inner man one must turn.</p><h2>A Walk in the Prairie (Biomes of North America)</h2><p><p>Take a walk through the prairie.

The word conjures images of towering sand dunes, unrelenting heat, and extremely dry conditions with little plant or animal life. In reality, the only characteristic rocky, sandy, cold, and hot deserts share is lack of moisture. The first section of titles considered here encourages readers in elementary and middle grades to look at deserts more closely. They can spend the day in the Sonoran Desert with an artist who creates <em>A Desert Scrapbook</em>, and they can learn that 'gross' animal adaptations help ensure survival. Some books, such as <em>Camels</em>, concentrate on specific animals while others, like <em>The Dry Desert: A Web of Life</em>, consider interconnections within the biome. </p> <p>Although not as dry as deserts, grasslands also lack abundant moisture. Whether waiting for a turn to drink from a water hole or for dark clouds to release rain on Kapiti Plain, grassland animals depend on water for survival. While reading books in the second half of this roundup, students can encounter lions, learn about African elephants, discover how various species live together in <em>Tree of Life: The World of the African Baobab</em>, and sharpen their language-arts skills with <em>African Acrostics</em>, featuring savanna animals. </p><p>People are part of the equation, too. Although some groups have lived in harmony with the desert for hundreds of years, contemporary societies need to deal with population growth, urbanization, climate change, and other destructive factors. The price of human mismanagement of an ecosystem can be high, as the history of United States grasslands demonstrates. Destroying prairie grasses that kept fertile soil in place and slaughtering grazing buffalo had disastrous consequences as both <em>Saving the Buffalo</em> and <em>The Dust Bowl Through the Lens</em> reveal. </p> <p><strong>Besides providing resources for units in science, ecology, and social studies, these titles foster a new appreciation for the diversity and complexity of biomes that cover vast sections of land around the world.</strong></p> <p>GRASSLANDS </p> <p>JOHNSON, Rebecca L. <em>A Walk in the Prairie</em>. illus. by Phyllis V.

For two centuries they have been practicing and training, passing down from generation to generation the formidable Threadfighting techniques. <br><br>Now the ominous signs are appearing: the violent winter storms and volcanic eruptions that are said to herald the approach of the Red Star and its lethal spawn. But one stubborn Lord Holder, Chalkin of Bitra, refuses to believe--and that disbelief could spell disaster.

For 257 years Pern has been free of the life-destroying Thread, but now the Red Star has reappeared in the sky and soon the deadly Threadfall will follow. In the holds and weyrs across the land, the genetically-engineered dragons of Pern and their human riders begin feverishly training to combat the Thread, for only dragon fire can destroy the silvery invaders. But, incredibly, one Lord Holder refuses to believe the Thread will fall again, and he may endanger the entire planet.There are dragons all over Anne McCaffrey's house. Some she's bought, but many have been made for her by adoring fans and given to her as gifts. I don't make dragons, of course. But whenever circumstances allow, I do try to bring her American bacon, something she can't get easily in Ireland, and something which she has taught all her friends there to love, as well! I remember the first time I went to visit her, when she was still living in her old, much smaller but very homey, house. My husband and I arrived at the doorstep, and she immediately began bustling about, frying up some of the bacon we'd brought and sharing a lovely late breakfast with us before sending us off to the hotel for a nap. She made us dinner that night, too--the one and only time in my life that I've actually liked shrimp cocktail.

Was he a national covenant maker like Moses, Abraham, Lehi, or Captain Moroni? Did he understand that he was fighting for the liberty of a promised land protected by God, a place where the Lord's holy temples could be built?</p> <p><br> The Washington Hypothesis explores the intriguing evidence that Washington and the other Founding Fathers knew the Lord had a greater purpose for America. It takes us on a fascinating historical journey through the miracles of the Revolutionary War to the foundational documents of this great nation to the symbolism evident in every corner of the nation's capital. Exploring how Washington's beliefs framed his every action, author Timothy Ballard draws compelling conclusions about the divinity of that great leader's calling.

This book is a general reference to the entire 24 book collection of ancient wisdom teachings written by Alice A. Bailey, in cooperation with a Master of the Wisdom. Topics include: The Ancient Mysteries, Courage, Crisis, Guidance, Joy, Mind, The New Age, Reincarnation, Healing and much more. This book is also available as an MP3 audiobook.</p><p>*Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>Fail Safe</h2><p><p>Something has gone wrong.

But <i>Family Table</i> is equally about technique; readers will find it crammed with instructive asides like "Using 'Pasta Water' to Make a Quick Sauce" (the water's starchiness can add body to sauces) and "Reduced Wine Vinegar for Vegetables" (heat-concentrated vinegar makes a deliciously mellow seasoning). <p> But the teaching doesn't stop there. Bastianich's discussions of risotto and polenta are particularly good (when preparing risotto, for example, the liquid must simmer for the dish to become properly toothsome), while a section on quick skillet sauces, like one made with sausage, onions, and fennel, will get many readers to the kitchen pronto. Bastianich also offers advice for preparing lesser-known yet attractive meat cuts like shoulder and butt, as well as quick-take recipes for the likes of whole corn cooked in tomato sauce and eggplant with scrambled eggs. The Bastianich approach also applies to the dessert section, which offers simple fruit-based sweets like Fig Focaccia, and Crostata with Poached Apricots and Pignolala. (Included, too, are a number of simple strudel recipes, a bow to the cooking of Istria, Bastianich's birthplace.)

What he discovered shocked him. <br><br>In 1905 President Teddy Roosevelt dispatched Secretary of War William Taft, his daughter Alice, and a gaggle of congressmen on a mission to Japan, the Philippines, China, and Korea with the intent of forging an agreement to divide up Asia. This clandestine pact lit the fuse that would-decades later-result in a number of devastating wars: WWII, the Korean War, and the communist revolution in China.<br><br>In 2005, James Bradley retraced that epic voyage and discovered the remarkable truth about America's vast imperial past. Full of fascinating characters brought brilliantly to life, <i>The Imperial Cruise</i> will powerfully revise the way we understand U.S. history.<br><br></p><p>James Bradley is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers <i>Flyboys </i>and <i>Flags of Our Fathers </i>and the son of one of the men who raised the American flag on Iwo Jima. He lives in New York.Theodore Roosevelt steers America onto the shoals of imperialism in this stridently disapproving study of early 20th-century U.S. policy in Asia. Bestselling author of <i>Flags of Our Fathers</i>, Bradley traces a 1905 voyage to Asia by Roosevelt's emissary William Howard Taft, who negotiated a secret agreement in which America and Japan recognized each other's conquests of the Philippines and Korea. (Roosevelt's flamboyant, pistol-packing daughter Alice went along to generate publicity, and Bradley highlights her antics.) Each port of call prompts a case study of American misdeeds: the brutal counterinsurgency in the Philippines; the takeover of Hawaii by American sugar barons; Roosevelt's betrayal of promises to protect Korea, which greenlighted Japanese expansionism and thus makes him responsible for Pearl Harbor. Bradley explores the racist underpinnings of Roosevelt's policies and paradoxical embrace of the Japanese as Honorary Aryans. Bradley's critique of Rooseveltian imperialism is compelling but unbalanced. He doesn't explain how Roosevelt could have evicted the Japanese from Korea, and insinuates that the Japanese imperial project was the brainstorm of American advisers. Ironically, his view of Asian history, like Roosevelt's, denies agency to the Asians themselves.

How, then, are we to respond today to a world so thoroughly entrenched in national and international affairs? But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, argues John Howard Yoder. <br><br>Using the texts of the New Testament, Yoder critically examines the traditional portrait of Jesus as an apolitical figure and attempts to clarify the true impact of Jesus' life, work, and teachings on his disciples' social behavior. <br><br>The book first surveys the multiple ways the image of an apolitical Jesus has been propagated, then canvasses the Gospel narrative to reveal how Jesus is rightly portrayed as a thinker and leader immediately concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. Selected passages from the epistles corroborate a Savior deeply concerned with social, political, and moral issues. <br><br>In this thorough revision of his acclaimed 1972 text, Yoder provides updated interaction with publications touching on this subject. Following most of the chapters are new "epilogues" that summarize research conducted during the last two decades -- research that continues to support the insights set forth in Yoder's original work. <br><br>Currently a standard in many college and seminary ethics courses, <i>The Politics of Jesus</i> is also an excellent resource for the general reader desiring to understand Christ's response to the world of politics and his will for those who would follow him.</p><p>Tradition has painted a portrait of a Savior who stands aloof from governmental concerns and who calls his disciples to an apolitical life. But such a picture of Jesus is far from accurate, according to John Howard Yoder. This watershed work in New Testament ethics leads us to a Savior who was deeply concerned with the agenda of politics and the related issues of power, status, and right relations. By canvassing Luke&#39;s Gospel, Yoder argues convincingly that the true impact of Jesus&#39; life and ministry on his disciples&#39; social behavior points to a specific kind of Christian pacifism in which &#34;the cross of Christ is the model of Christian social efficacy&#34;.

Kent, who during the next three decades became America's premier graphic artist, printmaker, and illustrator, was seeking time, peace, and solitude to work on his art and strengthen ties with his son. This reissue of the journal chronicling their 7-month odyssey describes what Kent called "an adventure of the spirit." He soon discovers how deeply he is "stirred by simple happenings in a quiet world" as man and boy face both the mundane and the magnificent: satisfaction in simple chores like woodchopping or baking; the appalling gloom of long and lonely winter nights; hours of silence while each works at his drawings; crystalline moonlight glancing off a frozen lake; killer whales cavorting in their bay. Richly illustrated by Kent's drawings, the journal vividly re-creates that sense of great height and space &#x2015; both external and internal &#x2015; at the same time that it celebrates a wilderness now nearly lost to us.</p><p>7 x 10 trim. 102 drawings. 5 photos.

Although he is perhaps best known for his illustrations for The Complete Works of William Shakespeare and Moby Dick, his artwork appeared everywhere at the height of his career. Kent also created the "random house" that, despite revision throughout the years, has been the colophon of that company since its inception in 1928. Kent's other travel books include N by E, Wilderness, and Voyaging, all reissued by Wesleyan University Press, a tribute to their perennial appeal.

Each of the twenty-seven books, written by various authors, has its own theological emphasis and nuances. How do we elicit a coherent message from such theological diversity, especially given that some of the theological statements in the New Testament seem to be at odds with one another? Is such an endeavor achievable or even valid?Theology of the New Testament takes a balanced approach in response to these challenges. Frank Thielman presents a theology of the New Testament that is careful to take into account the cultural and historical circumstances surrounding each book and the New Testament as a whole. He not only examines each book&#x2019;s theological content individually, but also in relation to the rest of the New Testament, particularly within each of the three theological units that comprise the New Testament: the gospels and Acts, the Pauline epistles, and the general epistles and Revelation. This canonical and synthetic approach honors both the theological diversity of the various books and the theological connections between the books. In the end, Thielman finds a unified theological vision of the New Testament, anchored in the centrality of Jesus Christ.Frank Thielman&#x2019;s Theology of the New Testament is an outstanding achievement. The book is marked by scholarly depth, exegetical rigor, and theological profundity. Both students and professors will profit immensely from this lucid treatment of the theology contained in the New Testament documents. Thomas R.

He is the author of <em>Philippians</em> in the NIV Application Commentary series.</p>Introduction Chapter 1 The Theology of the New Testament: The Basic Questions Since the eighteenth century, the discipline of New Testament theology has come under close scrutiny. Should the discipline be abandoned? Some have said so. Does it only need to be restructured? Some have offered new models. In the discussion, two problems with the discipline have repeatedly emerged as most significant. The first problem, it is said, is an unhealthy blend in the discipline of dogmatics with historical concerns. On the one hand, theological convictions influence New Testament theologians both in the conclusions they draw about the meaning of the New Testament texts and in their insistence on examining only the canonical documents. On the other hand, since the church values these documents largely for the historical claims made in them, New Testament theologians find that they must work as historians in much the same way that any historian would work with ancient texts. Is it possible to bring together faith and reason in this way, or must New Testament theologians bracket their own dogmatic presuppositions about the importance of the New Testament and place the canonical texts on a level with all other ancient texts? If so, then they should shift their attention away from the theologically biased investigation of 'New Testament theology' to the more objective and universally useful task of describing the history of early Christian thought. The second problem arises from the theological diversity of the New Testament texts. The New Testament documents not only express a variety of theological themes, but sometimes they speak in different ways on the same theme. Do these differences sometimes amount to contradiction? If not, why is the theological coherence of the New Testament sometimes so hard to detect? If so, is it accurate to speak of 'New Testament theology' at all, as if we are speaking of some coherent whole? Theology or History? Since the sixteenth century, biblical theologians have struggled with the relationship between interpreting the Bible to find support for the church's traditional theological teachings and interpreting the Bible within its own historical context without consideration for the theological convictions of the church. Because the church has traditionally held to the primacy of Scripture over its traditions (even if extrabiblical tradition is given great weight), ideally no conflict should arise. In fact, the church's traditions and the theological emphases of the Bible have often been incompatible, and so any study of biblical theology has often been characterized by the tension between theological conviction and historical analysis. Biblical theology arose early in the Reformation era as a discipline intended to chasten the church's unbiblical theological speculations and to hasten its reform. The emphasis at this time was more on theological reform than on sensitivity to the historical situations in which the biblical documents were composed. Later, biblical theology fell under the spell of Enlightenment rationalism, and some of its practitioners began to define the discipline in terms of a historically motivated and theologically independent study of the Bible that could use human reason to sit in judgment not only on the teachings of the church, but on the content of the Bible itself. Out of this link between biblical theology and the Enlightenment arose a criticism of the discipline itself. Why speak of 'biblical' theology at all? If the student of the biblical texts is to be truly an historian, then it is necessary to speak only of the history of Jewish and Christian thought and religion---to speak of the Bible, or of the New Testament, is already to speak in dogmatic language that the historian interested in the objective study of the past must find unacceptable. Over the last three centuries, three criticisms of the discipline as theologically rather than historically grounded have been particularly influential. J. P. Gabler, William Wrede, and Heikki R&#x2122;is&#x2122;nen, writing at the turn of the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries respectively, called for the liberation of the historical study of the Bible or early Christianity from the dogmatic concerns of the church. Gabler's seminal challenge differs from that of Wrede and R&#x2122;is&#x2122;nen because it is simply a call for methodological clarity in the theological enterprise rather than a disparagement of the theologically motivated study of the Bible. Nevertheless, both Wrede and R&#x2122;is&#x2122;nen understand themselves to be standing on the shoulders of Gabler. It is important, therefore, to consider Gabler's challenge to the discipline before evaluating the more direct attacks of Wrede and R&#x2122;is&#x2122;inen. In order to understand all three thinkers and to put our criticisms of their challenges in historical perspective, it is necessary first to survey briefly the historical roots of biblical, and specifically New Testament, theology. The Early History of the Discipline The development of a 'biblical theology' had its roots in the age-old commitment of the church to govern its theology and practice by the canonical writings of the Old and New Testaments. One of the most important concerns of the Reformation was that the church reform its doctrine and worship so that it might be more faithful to the standards laid down in the Bible. In 1521, Luther's close friend and colleague at the University of Wittenburg, Philip Melancthon, published one of the earliest theological treatises of the Reformation---a brief treatment of important theological topics based on Luther's lectures on Paul's letter to the Romans given in the summer of 1519 and repeated the following year. This treatment of Loci communes rerum theologicarum ('Fundamental Theological Themes') provided a list of important theological topics and then briefly explained the teaching of Scripture, and Scripture alone, on each topic. Melancthon was weary of reading the lengthy speculations of medieval scholastic theologians on Christian theology and wanted instead to discover how the Bible itself, and particularly 'Paul's own compendium of Christian doctrine' in Romans, described the Christian religion. This urge to tap speculative theologians on the shoulder and point them back to the Bible remained a constant theme in the early history of biblical theology as a discrete discipline. Melancthon puts it this way: I am discussing everything sparingly and briefly because the book is to function more as an index than a commentary. I am therefore merely stating a list of the topics to which a person roaming through Scripture should be directed. Further, I am setting forth in only a few words the elements on which the main points of Christian doctrine are based. I do this not to call students away from the Scriptures to obscure and complicated arguments but, rather, to summon them to the Scriptures if I can. As the Reformation matured into Protestantism, however, Protestant thinkers began to refine their theological commitments and to develop complicated theological arguments of their own. In their works, Scripture was often used not so much to set the theological agenda but to demonstrate that the various theological principles that Protestants considered important, and which were now growing increasingly complex, were, in fact, biblical. Those who first used the term 'biblical theology' to describe their theological studies made this proof-texting of preexisting theological systems their goal. A new Protestant brand of scholasticism began to develop with 'biblical theology' as its handmaid. Under the influence of German pietism on one hand and rationalism on the other, biblical theology began to break away from this role as a prop for systematic theology.</p><h2>The House of Mirth (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels)</h2><p><p>A bestseller when it was originally published nearly a century ago, Wharton's first literary success was set amid the previously unexplored territory of fashionable, turn-of-the-century New York society, an area with which she was intimately familiar.<br>The tragic love story reveals the destructive effects of wealth and social hypocrisy on Lily Bart, a ravishing beauty. Impoverished but well-born, Lily realizes a secure future depends on her acquiring a wealthy husband. Her downfall begins with a romantic indiscretion, intensifies with an accumulation of gambling debts, and climaxes in a maelstrom of social disasters.<br>More a tale of social exclusion than of failed love, <i>The House of Mirth</i> reveals Wharton's compelling gifts as a storyteller and her clear-eyed observations of the savagery beneath the well-bred surface of high society. As with <i>The Age of Innocence</i> and <i>Ethan Frome</i>, this novel was also made into a successful motion picture.</p></p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Woody Plants in Winter: A Manual of Common Trees and Shrubs in Winter in the Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada</h2><p><p>A manual to identify trees and shrubs in winter when the lack of leaves, fruits, and flowers makes them least identifiable, <i>Woody Plants in Winter</i> has become a classic for naturalists, botanists, gardeners, and hobbyists.

Which Rationality?</i>, the sequel to <i>After Virtue</i>, is a persuasive argument of there not being rationality that is not the rationality of some tradition. MacIntyre examines the problems presented by the existence of rival traditions of inquiry in the cases of four major philosophers: Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and Hume.</p><p>Alasdair MacIntyre is research professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author of numerous books, including <i>After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory</i>, Third Edition (Notre Dame Press, 2007) and <i>Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition</i> (Notre Dame Press, 1990).Is there any cause or war worth risking one's life for? How can we determine which actions are vices and which virtues? MacIntyre, professor of philosophy at Vanderbilt University, unravels these and other such questions by linking the concept of justice to what he calls practical rationality. He rejects the grab-what-you-can, utilitarian yardstick adopted by moral relativists. Instead, he argues that four wholly different, incompatible ideas of justiceput forth by Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas and Humehave helped shape our modern individualistic world. In his unorthodox view, each person seeks the good through an ongoing dialogue with one of these traditions or within Jewish, non-Western or other historical traditions. This weighty sequel to After Virtue (1981) is certain to stir debate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Clue of the Velvet Mask (Nancy Drew #30)</h2><p>A masquerade party at the Hendricks&#x2019; mansion quickly turns into a mystery when Nancy and her favorite date, Ned Nickerson, spy a stranger about to climb the rose trellis to the second story.

She has written three novels, WHEN GOD WAS A RABBIT, A YEAR OF MARVELLOUS WAYS and TIN MAN.Winman debuts with a heartbreaking story of the secrets and hopes of a sister and brother who share an unshakable bond. Elly and her older brother, Joe, appear to be just like all the other kids in mid-1970s Essex, U.K., but, as is often the case, shocking secrets lurk below the surface for the siblings and Elly's best friend, Jenny Penny&#x2014;one has been sexually abused, another has an alcoholic and promiscuous mother, another is homosexual&#x2014;and the weight of bearing each other's traumas erupts in hard to watch ways. As the years go on, each moves forward; for Elly and Joe, this is more easily accomplished, as their family moves away from Essex and Joe's secret is brought to light, relief Elly doesn't receive until much later. As the story winds through time and across the Atlantic, the trio and their families are rocked by 9/11, leading to a final twist that strains belief before settling into acceptable inevitability. Winman shows impressive range and vision in breaking out of the muted coming-of-age mold, and the narrative's intensity will appeal to readers who like a little gloom.

At the time, all of my girlfriends had their noses buried in it, and like me they found it compulsive and compelling reading.

From plays to official events to grassroots protests, performance, she argues, must be taken seriously as a means of storing and transmitting knowledge. Taylor reveals how the repertoire of embodied memory&#x2014;conveyed in gestures, the spoken word, movement, dance, song, and other performances&#x2014;offers alternative perspectives to those derived from the written archive and is particularly useful to a reconsideration of historical processes of transnational contact. <i>The Archive and the Repertoire</i> invites a remapping of the Americas based on traditions of embodied practice.<p></p><p>Examining various genres of performance including demonstrations by the children of the disappeared in Argentina, the Peruvian theatre group Yuyachkani, and televised astrological readings by Univision personality Walter Mercado, Taylor explores how the archive and the repertoire work together to make political claims, transmit traumatic memory, and forge a new sense of cultural identity. Through her consideration of performances such as Coco Fusco and Guillermo G�mez-Pe�a&#x2019;s show <i>Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit . . . , </i>Taylor illuminates how scenarios of discovery and conquest haunt the Americas, trapping even those who attempt to dismantle them. Meditating on events like those of September 11, 2001 and media representations of them, she examines both the crucial role of performance in contemporary culture and her own role as witness to and participant in hemispheric dramas. <i>The Archive and the Repertoire</i> is a compelling demonstration of the many ways that the study of performance enables a deeper understanding of the past and present, of ourselves and others.</p></p><p>&#34;&#34;The Archive and the Repertoire&#34; is an original and brilliant contribution. It will take the study of Latin American performance to a new level with its attention not only to politics and to history and its consequences, but also to memory, the media, and aesthetic/political practices that take into account the hemispheric and the global.&#34;--Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano, author of &#34;The Wounded Heart: Writing on Cherrie Moraga&#34;<p>Diana Taylor is Professor of Performance Studies and Spanish and Director of the Hemispheric Institute on Performance and Politics at New York University.

She always dreams big.Lady Never Surrenders Chapter One<p></p> <br>Ealing<br>November 1825<br> <br>When Bow Street Runner Jackson Pinter entered Halstead Hall&#x2019;s library, he wasn&#x2019;t surprised to find only one person there. He was early, and no one in the Sharpe family was ever early. <br> <br>&#x201c;Good morning, Masters,&#x201d; Jackson said, inclining his head toward the barrister who sat poring over some papers. Giles Masters was husband to the eldest Sharpe sister, Lady Minerva. Or Mrs. Masters, as she&#x2019;d chosen to be called. <br> <br>Masters looked up. &#x201c;Pinter! Good to see you, old fellow. How are things at Bow Street?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well enough for me to take the time to hold this meeting.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I daresay the Sharpes have run you ragged investigating their parents&#x2019; deaths.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Murders,&#x201d; Jackson corrected him. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve determined that for certain now.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. I forgot that Minerva said the pistol found at the scene had never been fired. A pity no one noticed it nineteen years ago, or an investigation might have been mounted then and a great deal of heartache prevented.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Plumtree paid off anyone who might have explored further.&#x201d;<br> <br>Masters sighed. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t blame her. She thought she was preventing scandal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson frowned. Instead she&#x2019;d prevented the discovery of the truth. And that was why she&#x2019;d ended up with five grandchildren stuck in the past, unable to go on with their lives. That&#x2019;s why she&#x2019;d laid down her ultimatum&#x2014;all of them had to marry by the end of the year or none would inherit. So far, they&#x2019;d obliged her. All but one. <br> <br>In his mind arose an image of Lady Celia that he swiftly squelched.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is everyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Still at breakfast. They&#x2019;ll be trooping across the courtyard soon, I&#x2019;m sure. Have a seat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stand.&#x201d; He strode over to the window that overlooked the Crimson Courtyard, named for its red tile. <br> <br>Being at Halstead Hall always made Jackson uneasy. The sprawling mansion shrieked &#x201c;aristocracy.&#x201d; Having spent his early childhood in a Liverpool slum before moving to a terrace house in Cheapside at age ten, he found Halstead Hall too large, too sumptuous&#x2014;and too full of Sharpes. <br> <br>After nearly a year with them as his clients, he still wasn&#x2019;t sure how he felt about them. Even now, as he saw them walking across the courtyard beneath a cloud-darkened November sky, he tensed up. <br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t look as if they planned to spring anything on him. They looked happy and content.<br> <br>First came the great lord himself&#x2014;Oliver Sharpe, the ninth Marquess of Stoneville, said to be a near copy of his olive-skinned, black-haired, and black-eyed father. Initially Jackson had despised the man, having made the mistake of believing the gossip about him. He still thought Stoneville had chosen the wrong path after his parents&#x2019; deaths, but since the marquess seemed to be making up for it now, perhaps there was good in him after all. <br> <br>Beside him walked Lord Jarret, whose blue-green eyes and black hair were said to make him look more a blend of his half-Italian father and blond mother. He was Jackson&#x2019;s favorite of the brothers. No-nonsense and even-tempered, Jarret was the easiest to talk to. And once his scheming maternal grandmother, Mrs. Hester Plumtree, had allowed him to take over the family business, the man had flourished. Jarret worked hard at Plumtree Brewery; Jackson could admire that.<br> <br>After him came Lord Gabriel with his new wife, Lady Gabriel, on one arm. No doubt the other two men&#x2019;s wives were in their confinement&#x2014;Lady Stoneville was expected to deliver within the month, and Lady Jarret wasn&#x2019;t far behind. But Jackson wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised to hear of an impending child soon from the youngest Sharpe brother. The couple seemed very much in love, which was rather astonishing, considering that their marriage had initially been contracted just to fulfill Mrs. Plumtree&#x2019;s ridiculous ultimatum. <br> <br>That august woman clung to Gabe&#x2019;s other arm. Jackson admired Mrs. Plumtree&#x2019;s determination and pluck&#x2014;it reminded him of his beloved aunt Ada, who&#x2019;d raised him and now lived with him. But what the elderly woman was demanding of her grandchildren reeked of hubris. No one should have such power over their descendants, not even a legend like Hetty Plumtree, who&#x2019;d singlehandedly built the family brewery into a major concern after the death of her husband.<br> <br>Behind her, the two Sharpe sisters came out to cross the courtyard. He dragged in a heavy breath as the younger one caught his eye.<br> <br>Masters approached to look out the window, too. &#x201c;And there she comes, the most beautiful woman in the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And the most maddening,&#x201d; Jackson muttered.<br> <br>&#x201c;Watch it, Pinter,&#x201d; Masters said in a voice tinged with amusement. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my wife you&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson started. He hadn&#x2019;t been staring at Mrs. Masters. &#x201c;I beg your pardon,&#x201d; he murmured, figuring he&#x2019;d best not explain.<br> <br>Masters would never accept that Lady Celia was to her sister as a gazelle was to a brood mare. The newly wedded barrister was blinded by love. <br> <br>Jackson wasn&#x2019;t. Any fool could see that Lady Celia was the more arresting of the two. While Mrs. Masters had the lush charms of a dockside tart, Lady Celia was a Greek goddess&#x2014;willowy and tall, small-breasted and long-limbed, with a fine lady&#x2019;s elegant brow, a doe&#x2019;s soft eyes. ... <br> <br>And a vixen&#x2019;s temper. The damned female could flay the flesh from a man&#x2019;s bones with her sharp tongue. <br> <br>She could also heat his blood with one unguarded smile. <br> <br>God save him, it was a good thing her smile had never been bestowed on him. Otherwise, he might act on the fantasy that had plagued him from the day he&#x2019;d met her&#x2014;to shove her into some private closet where he could plunder her mouth with impunity. Where she would wrap those slender arms about his neck and let him have his way with her. <br> <br>Confound her, until she had come along, he&#x2019;d never allowed himself to desire a woman he couldn&#x2019;t have. He&#x2019;d rarely allowed himself to desire anyone, only the occasional whore when he felt desperate for female companionship. Now he couldn&#x2019;t seem to stop doing so. <br> <br>It was because he&#x2019;d seen too little of her lately. What he needed was a surfeit of Lady Celia to make him sick of her. Then he might purge this endless craving for the impossible.<br> <br>With a scowl, he turned from the window, but it was too late. The sight of Lady Celia crossing the courtyard dressed in some rich fabric had already stirred his blood. She never wore such fetching clothes; generally her lithe figure was shrouded in smocks to protect her workaday gowns from powder smudges while she practiced her target shooting. <br> <br>But this morning, in that lemon-colored gown, with her hair finely arranged and a jeweled bracelet on her delicate wrist, she was summer on a dreary winter day, sunshine in the bleak of night, music in the still silence of a deserted concert hall.<br> <br>And he was a fool.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can see how you might find her maddening,&#x201d; Masters said in a low voice. <br> <br>Jackson stiffened. &#x201c;Your wife?&#x201d; he said, deliberately being obtuse.<br> <br>&#x201c;Lady Celia.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hell and blazes. He&#x2019;d obviously let his feelings show. He&#x2019;d spent his childhood learning to keep them hidden so the other children wouldn&#x2019;t see how their epithets wounded him, and he&#x2019;d refined that talent as an investigator who knew the value of an unemotional demeanor. <br> <br>He drew on that talent as he faced the barrister. &#x201c;Anyone would find her maddening. She&#x2019;s reckless and spoiled and liable to give her future husband grief at every turn.&#x201d; When she wasn&#x2019;t tempting him to madness.<br> <br>Masters raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;Yet you often watch her. Have you any interest there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson forced a shrug. &#x201c;Certainly not. You&#x2019;ll have to find another way to inherit your new bride&#x2019;s fortune.&#x201d;<br> <br>He&#x2019;d hoped to prick Masters&#x2019;s pride and thus change the subject, but Masters laughed. &#x201c;You, marry my sister-in-law? That, I&#x2019;d like to see. Aside from the fact that her grandmother would never approve, Lady Celia hates you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She did indeed. The chit had taken an instant dislike to him when he&#x2019;d interfered in an impromptu shooting match she&#x2019;d been participating in with her brother and his friends at a public park. That should have set him on his guard right then.<br> <br>A pity it hadn&#x2019;t. Because even if she didn&#x2019;t despise him and weren&#x2019;t miles above him in rank, she&#x2019;d never make him a good wife. She was young and indulged, not the sort of female to make do on a Bow Street Runner&#x2019;s salary.<br> <br>But she&#x2019;ll be an heiress once she marries.<br> <br>He gritted his teeth. That only made matters worse. She would assume he was marrying her for her inheritance. So would everyone else. And his pride chafed at that.<br> <br>Dirty bastard. Son of shame. Whoreson. Love-brat. He&#x2019;d been called them all as a boy. Later, as he&#x2019;d moved up at Bow Street, those who resented his rapid advancement had called him a baseborn upstart. He wasn&#x2019;t about to add money-grubbing fortune hunter to the list.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides,&#x201d; Masters went on, &#x201c;you may not realize this, since you haven&#x2019;t been around much these past few weeks, but Minerva claims that Celia has her eye on three very eligible potential suitors.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson&#x2019;s startled gaze shot to him. Suitors? The word who was on his lips when the door opened and Stoneville entered. The rest of the family followed, leaving Jackson to force a smile and exchange pleasantries as they settled into seats about the table, but his mind kept running over Masters&#x2019;s words. <br> <br>Lady Celia had suitors. Eligible ones. Good&#x2014;that was good. He needn&#x2019;t worry about himself around her anymore. She was now out of his reach, thank God. Not that she was ever in his reach, but&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you got news?&#x201d; Stoneville asked.<br> <br>Jackson started. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; He took a steadying breath and forced his mind to the matter at hand. &#x201c;As you know, your father&#x2019;s valet insists that your father wasn&#x2019;t having an affair with Mrs. Rawdon nineteen years ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which I still don&#x2019;t believe,&#x201d; Stoneville put in. &#x201c;She certainly led me to think otherwise when she ... er ... was found in my room.&#x201d;<br> <br>In his lordship&#x2019;s bed, to be precise. Although the entire family now knew of Mrs. Rawdon&#x2019;s seduction of the sixteen-year-old heir on the day of his parents&#x2019; deaths, it wasn&#x2019;t something they liked to dwell on, least of all Stoneville. <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m aware of that,&#x201d; Jackson said. &#x201c;Which is why I&#x2019;ve been trying to confirm it through another source.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What source?&#x201d; Mrs. Masters asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mrs. Rawdon&#x2019;s former lady&#x2019;s maid, Elsie. The valet wouldn&#x2019;t have been the only servant with private information. If your father and Mrs. Rawdon were involved, her lady&#x2019;s maid probably knew of it, too.&#x201d; He sucked in a breath. &#x201c;Unfortunately, I haven&#x2019;t yet located Elsie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then why are we here?&#x201d; Jarret asked, always right to the point.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because while searching for her, I discovered a curious circumstance. It seems that her last place of employ was with a rich gentleman in Manchester.&#x201d;<br> <br>Although the others took a moment to catch the significance of that, Jarret and Gabe realized it at once. They&#x2019;d been with Jackson at the inquest of Halstead Hall&#x2019;s former head groom, Benny May, whose body had been found after he&#x2019;d traveled to visit a &#x201c;friend&#x201d; in Manchester.<br> <br>&#x201c;Surely you don&#x2019;t think that Elsie might have had something to do with Benny&#x2019;s death,&#x201d; Mrs. Plumtree exclaimed, horror showing in her aging features.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have no idea,&#x201d; Jackson said. &#x201c;But it seems quite the coincidence that Benny would travel to where Elsie had been, only to end up dead shortly after he left that city.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Had been?&#x201d; Gabe asked. &#x201c;Elsie left Manchester?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She did. I find that suspicious. According to her family, she sent them a quick note saying she was leaving her post and heading to London to look for a new one. Apparently, she&#x2019;d always refused to tell them the identity of her employer. They suspected she was involved with the man romantically. Whatever the case, I&#x2019;m having trouble finding her. No one in Manchester seems to know anything. But she told her family she would send them word as soon as she settled in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it possible we&#x2019;re barking up the wrong tree with Elsie and Benny?&#x201d; Stoneville asked. &#x201c;The authorities were never sure he was murdered. He might have been the victim of a hunting accident. Elsie might have moved on because she didn&#x2019;t like her employer. Their both being in Manchester at the same time could be coincidence.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; But in Jackson&#x2019;s business, genuine coincidences were rare. &#x201c;I did learn she was younger than your mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Quite pretty, too, as I recall,&#x201d; Stoneville said. <br> <br>&#x201c;How strange that Mrs. Rawdon would have a fetching young lady&#x2019;s maid,&#x201d; Mrs. Plumtree said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s asking for trouble, men being what they are.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not all men, Gran,&#x201d; Mrs. Masters said stoutly.<br> <br>Mrs. Plumtree cast a glance about the table, then smiled. &#x201c;No, not all men.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackson fought to shield his thoughts. Masters did seem an excellent husband, but he&#x2019;d already reformed by the time he&#x2019;d begun courting his wife. And the Sharpe men seemed devoted to their wives, but would it last? <br> <br>His mother had been seduced by a nobleman, a brash young lord in Liverpool with a penchant for sweet maidens. Instead of marrying her, the arse had married a wealthy woman and set up Jackson&#x2019;s mother as his mistress, abandoning her when Jackson was two. So Jackson had no illusions about what marriage meant to the aristocracy. <br> <br>Don&#x2019;t blame your father, Mother had said as she lay dying in his aunt and uncle&#x2019;s home. If not for him, I wouldn&#x2019;t have you. And that made it all worth it.<br> <br>He couldn&#x2019;t see how. The memory of her emaciated body lying on that bed ...<br> <br>With an effort, he tamped down his anger and forced himself to pay attention to the matter at hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting to hear from Elsie&#x2019;s family about her location in London. I heard from Major Rawdon&#x2019;s regiment in India that he&#x2019;d taken a three-year post in Gibraltar, so I&#x2019;ve sent a letter there asking him questions concerning the house party. Until I get responses, I should stay close to town rather than returning to Manchester on a probable wild-goose chase.&#x201d; He glanced to the marquess. &#x201c;With your lordship&#x2019;s approval.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever you think is best,&#x201d; Stoneville murmured. &#x201c;Just keep us apprised.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br> <br>Taking that for a dismissal, Jackson headed out the door. He had another appointment this afternoon, and he had to stop at home to pick up the report his aunt was transcribing. Only she could transform his scribbles into legible, intelligible prose. If he left now, he might have time to eat before&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Pinter!&#x201d; <br> <br>He turned to find Lady Celia approaching. &#x201c;Yes, my lady?&#x201d;<br> <br>To his surprise, she glanced nervously at the open door to the library and lowered her voice. &#x201c;I must speak to you privately. Do you have a moment?&#x201d;<br> <br>He ruthlessly suppressed the leap in his pulse. Lady Celia had never asked to talk to him alone. The singularity of that made him nod curtly and gesture to a nearby parlor.<br> <br>She preceded him, then stood looking about her with uncharacteristic anxiousness as he entered and left the door open, wanting no one to accuse him of impropriety.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; he asked, trying not to sound impatient. Or intrigued. He&#x2019;d never seen Lady Celia looking unsure of herself. It tugged annoyingly at his sympathies. <br> <br>&#x201c;I had a dream last night. That is, I&#x2019;m not sure if it actually was a dream...</p><h2>Medical-Surgical Nursing</h2><p><p>Gain the knowledge and skills you need to effectively care for adult patients. <b>Medical-Surgical Nursing, 7th Edition</b> covers both medical-surgical and psychiatric mental health conditions and disorders while building on the fundamentals of nursing.

If you look on the super- market shelves, you&#x2019;ll see numer- ous dog foods that claim to aid in intelligence. I don&#x2019;t know if diet can&nbsp;increase intelligence, and dogs cannot take IQ tests to prove this one way or the other. However, I do believe &#x201c;stimulating&#x201d; a dog during early puppyhood can result in a stronger, more balanced brain.<br> &nbsp;<br> A puppy&#x2019;s brain is like a sponge&#x2014;soaking up all the smells and sights and experiences in the world as fast as it can. A well-stimulated pup will grow up to have a larger brain with more cells, bigger cells, and more interconnections between them. Hearing loud noises, getting regular exercise, meeting new dogs and people, traveling to new places, and even going through agility course training for a few minutes each day make for a stronger brain. We can influence the development of a puppy&#x2019;s brain by providing him with the best environment possible when he is a newborn pup.<br> &nbsp;<br> Likewise, a dog that is deprived of stimulation or that doesn&#x2019;t have interactions with other dogs or humans is more likely to have a smaller brain and be less balanced. I have seen many situations in which an understimulated dog is not only an unhappy dog but also a dull, almost lifeless animal.<br> &nbsp;<br> But, conversely, too much of a good thing can be harmful. I have also seen situations in which overstimulating a dog can lead to behavior problems and aggression. Signs of overstimulation can be seen in a dog who enters a room or approaches another dog face-to-face, with his tongue hanging out, gasping for breath, and pulling on the leash or barking. A lot of dog owners misinterpret these signs as those of a &#x201c;happy&#x201d; dog, but in reality, such dogs are out of control. When you see these signs, your dog needs calm, deliberate handling, and it&#x2019;s best to move him away from whatever is overstimulating him until he has calmed down.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Challenging Your Dog&#x2019;s Mind:</b><br> Keeping your dogs mentally challenged and constantly exposing them to new things are just as important as taking them for walks and exercising them. Bored dogs develop destructive behaviors and take their negative energy out on things like your furniture. Here are some creative ways to stimulate your dog&#x2019;s mind:<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Work on a new trick. Every time you engage your dog in a training session, you are providing him with a mental challenge. Search around for new tricks to learn and practice. If you&#x2019;re ready to move past the basic commands of &#x201c;sit,&#x201d; &#x201c;stay,&#x201d; and &#x201c;come&#x201d; . . . try linking commands together like &#x201c;retrieve and sit.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Play with interactive games or toys. Dog toys have evolved beyond rubber squeaky toys and cloth squirrels. I like to use canine puzzles that allow you to hide treats and objects inside the puzzle, which engage your dog in figuring out how to work them out. If you don&#x2019;t have a puzzle, you can hold a treat in one hand and let your dog figure out which hand is hiding the treat. Because dogs have such a powerful sense of smell, your dog will guess right 100 percent of the time.<br> 3. Change your walk routine. Try a different street or park just to keep it interesting for your dog.<br> &nbsp;<br> 4. Give your dog a job to do. Dogs are bred to complete tasks like hunting and herding. Engage your dog in a game of&nbsp;Frisbee. Get him involved in a sport like agility or flyball. Find jobs that fulfill your dog&#x2019;s breed.<br> 5. Socialize your dog. Dogs are social animals, and you should nurture the need for social activity by planning playdates with other compatible dogs.</p><h2>What Really Matters for Struggling Readers: Designing Research-Based Programs</h2><p><p> <b>A part of the<i> What Really Matters</i> series, the Third Edition of <i>What Really Matters for Struggling Readers</i> examines the </b> <b>increasing amount of research demonstrating that we can teach every child to read.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Using non-technical summaries, nationally recognized scholar and author Dick Allington delivers a concise and balanced introduction to reading remediation and intervention programs; showing teachers how to use a variety of best practices with children who are struggling readers in order to transform them into proficient readers.

Bolen frames the search for meaning at mid-life as a quest for the mysterious lost Grail of the Arthurian legend. For Bolen, the Grail represents the elusive object of a lifelong search for what is missing from our lives as well as from our culture. Bolen&#39;s pursuit takes her on an incredible journey to Europe that leads her to discover the importance of her own history, the changes and challenges at mid-life, and the meaning of the goddess in the lives of women. During a particularly difficult time in her life, Jean Bolen quite unexpectedly received a package in the mail from England. Inside was a beautiful gold pendant in the shape of an ancient archetypal image along with an invitation to make a pilgrimage to Chartres, Glastonbury, Iona and other sacred sites in Europe. It was sent by a total stranger, a woman who had come across one of the first copies of Goddesses in Everywoman, Bolen&#39;s ground-breaking work on women and archetypal myth. The synchronicity of the invitation was astonishing to Bolen, and she knew instinctively that she had been invited to embark on a quest that would change her life. So began the extraordinary pilgrimage that heralded Bolen&#39;s mid-life passage. Inspired by The Mists of Avalon, this tale of her European adventure is interwoven with penetrating psychological and spiritual insights as well as lore from Europe&#39;s sacred sites. While on her pilgrimage, Bolen reflects on the mystical experience that brought her into medicine, her awakening to the archetypal feminine through the experience of childbirth, the personal transformations that occurred after her divorce, the sources and significance of mid-life depression, and the importance of female friendship. This multilayered account journeys through and beyond the personal to reflect the mythological significance of the mid-life search for meaning and renewal.<p>Jean Shinoda Bolen, MD, is a psychiatrist, a Jungian analyst, and an internationally known author and speaker. Her books include <em>Goddesses in Everywoman</em>, <em>Gods in Everyman</em>, and many others.

We thought we were something else.</p><p>&#x2014;Robert Stone, Dog Soldiers (1974)</p><p>&#x201c;I DIDN&#x2019;T KNOW there was a bad war,&#x201d; George Evans recalled. He grew up in Pittsburgh in the 1950s. Starting at age six, before and after school, he helped his father deliver blocks of ice to poor and working-class people who could not afford the shiny new refrigerators advertised in all the magazines. George understood that the American Dream was beyond the grasp of his parents and most of their friends and neighbors. He was a streetwise kid. He knew life was difficult and the future uncertain.</p><p>But there was one thing George trusted completely&#x2014;his nation&#x2019;s military power and the good that it did. With all his heart he believed the United States was on the side of justice and freedom and all our wars were noble. Despite personal hardships, you could always count on Americans to be the good guys, and always victorious. It was simply unimaginable that the United States might betray that faith.</p><p>&#x201c;I was raised in a family and neighborhood of extreme patriots,&#x201d; George explains. &#x201c;My father was the commander of his VFW post and I got to go to the club and hang out with the veterans. I was their little mascot.&#x201d; He especially looked forward to Flag Day, when he would help the World War II vets decorate the graves in a military cemetery. &#x201c;Imagine how beautiful it looked to a kid to see hundreds of graves in a geometric pattern, all with shining bronze plates and flags waving in the wind. You just can&#x2019;t exaggerate the pull of the military on kids from neighborhoods like mine. Everything you&#x2019;d seen and heard your whole life made it feel inevitable and right.&#x201d;</p><p>But George&#x2019;s faith in America&#x2019;s global goodness was forever destroyed in Vietnam, where he served as an air force medic. &#x201c;I realized that the country I was from was not the country I thought it was.&#x201d; One day at the hospital in Cam Ranh Bay he was ordered to clean the bodies of two young Vietnamese boys. They were dead. As he was sponging one of them with soapy water, a Vietnamese woman raced into the room. She must have been the mother, but George wasn&#x2019;t sure. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forget her face. I can see her still. I remember her hitting me on the chest, grabbing me. Then she was running back and forth between the two bodies, from child to child.&#x201d; George later learned that the boys were hit by an American military truck driver who may have been competing with other drivers over &#x201c;who could hit a kid. They had some disgusting name for it, something like &#x2018;gook hockey.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>With the possible exception of the Civil War, no event in U.S. history has demanded more soul-searching than the war in Vietnam. The false pretexts used to justify our intervention, the indiscriminate brutality of our warfare, the stubborn refusal of elected leaders to withdraw despite public opposition, and the stunning failure to achieve our stated objectives&#x2014;these harrowing realities provoked a profound national identity crisis, an American reckoning. The war made citizens ask fundamental questions: Who are we? What defines us as a nation and a people? What is our role in the world? Just as the Civil War forced Americans to confront the reality of slavery, an institution that stood in glaring contradiction to the nation&#x2019;s avowed ideals of human freedom and equality, the Vietnam War compelled millions of citizens to question the once widely held faith that their country is the greatest force for good in the world, that it always acts to advance democracy and human rights, that it is superior in both its power and its virtue. And just as the Civil War ended slavery without resolving racism and racial injustice, the Vietnam War ended without resolving the conflicting lessons and legacies of America&#x2019;s first defeat.</p><p>The Vietnam War still matters because the crucial questions it raised remain with us today: Should we continue to seek global military superiority? Can we use our power justly? Can we successfully intervene in distant lands to crush insurgencies (or support them), establish order, and promote democracy? What degree of sacrifice will the public bear and who among us should bear it? Is it possible for American citizens and their elected representatives to change our nation&#x2019;s foreign policy or is it permanently controlled by an imperial presidency and an unaccountable military-industrial complex?</p><p>Our answers to those questions are shaped by the experience and memory of the Vietnam War, but in ways that are cloudy and confusing as well as contested. I believe we could make better contributions to our current debates if we had a clearer understanding of that war&#x2019;s impact on our national identity, from its origins after World War II all the way to the present. But this is not a conventional chronological history. There are already many good ones. Nor am I interested in irresolvable speculation about how the war might have turned out differently if only other decisions had been made or alternative strategies pursued. I want instead to explore the ways the war changed our national self-perception. It is such an important and even obvious subject you might assume it has been thoroughly examined and exhausted. After all, there is now a vast literature about various aspects of the Vietnam War&#x2014;so many books we don&#x2019;t even have a precise count and no one could possibly read them all. Surprisingly, however, only a small number have taken on this topic and none have tracked it over a six-decade span. My ambition, therefore, is not just to enrich our understanding of the Vietnam War, but to show how we have wrestled with the myths and realities of our nation&#x2019;s global role from the early days of the Cold War to the wars of the twenty-first century.</p><p>To do so, I have drawn on a great variety of sources&#x2014;everything from movies, songs, memoirs, novels, and advertisements to official documents, polling data, media coverage, Pentagon studies, government propaganda, presidential speeches, and contemporary commentary. And, of course, I have relied on a long list of superb scholars and journalists whose work made this one possible.</p><p>My main argument is that the Vietnam War shattered the central tenet of American national identity&#x2014;the broad faith that the United States is a unique force for good in the world, superior not only in its military and economic power, but in the quality of its government and institutions, the character and morality of its people, and its way of life. A common term for this belief is &#x201c;American exceptionalism.&#x201d; Because that term has been bandied about so much in recent years as a political slogan and a litmus test of patriotism, we need to be reminded that it has deep roots and meaning throughout our history. In many ways the nation was founded on the faith that it was blessed with unrivaled resources, freedoms, and prospects. So deep were those convictions they took on the power of myth&#x2014;they were beyond debate. Dissenting movements throughout our history did little to challenge the faith.</p><p>That&#x2019;s what made the Vietnam War&#x2019;s impact so significant. Never before had such a wide range of Americans come to doubt their nation&#x2019;s superiority; never before had so many questioned its use of military force; never before had so many challenged the assumption that their country had higher moral standards.</p><p>Of course, the faith in American exceptionalism has hardly disappeared. Countless times since the Vietnam War our presidents have invoked it in support of wars and interventions around the world. Although the public has been more reluctant to use military force than its leaders, there is still substantial support for the idea that our power is benign and that America remains a singularly admirable nation. That&#x2019;s why virtually everyone who runs for higher office in the United States pledges allegiance to the creed.</p><p>Yet even many ardent believers understand that the faith is no longer as broad or assured as it was before the Vietnam War. In 2000, for example, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the war&#x2019;s end, Henry Kissinger wrote: &#x201c;One of the most important casualties of the Vietnam tragedy was the tradition of American &#x2018;exceptionalism.&#x2019; The once near-universal faith in the uniqueness of our values&#x2014;and their relevance around the world&#x2014;gave way to intense divisions over the very validity of those values and the lengths we should go to promote and defend them.&#x201d; Kissinger had been almost as responsible as President Richard Nixon for prolonging the Vietnam War an additional six years. When it finally ended in 1975, 58,000 Americans had died, and three million Vietnamese. Yet in 2000 Kissinger chose to mourn the loss of American exceptionalism. For him, there was nothing so terrible about the war to justify any doubt about our nation&#x2019;s superiority.</p><p>Unlike Kissinger, many others believed the war exposed American exceptionalism as a dangerous myth. They did not regret its passing. National aggrandizement had led the United States into an unjust and unwinnable war. In Robert Stone&#x2019;s 1974 novel Dog Soldiers, for example, John Converse is a disillusioned American journalist in Vietnam who persuades an old Marine Corps buddy to smuggle heroin into the United States. As they discuss the deal, with gunfire in the background, Converse says: &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t know who we were till we got here. We thought we were something else.&#x201d; The war, he implies, was a kind of awakening. It enabled Americans to recognize their capacity for bloodlust and evil. His friend Ray Hicks offers a witheringly sardonic comment about the price of that awakening: &#x201c;What a bummer for the gooks,&#x201d; he says. Americans were learning hard truths about themselves and their nation on the backs of a people they dehumanized and killed and whose country they wrecked. It was an expensive education and Vietnam bore by far its greatest cost.</p><p>For many people, major reappraisals came slowly, a testament to their deep trust in American institutions and values. In the 1950s and early 1960s, before the major military escalation in Vietnam and the shocking revelations it brought, Americans had remarkable faith in their elected officials. Until the mid-1960s, roughly three-quarters of Americans told pollsters they trusted the government to do the right thing. Therefore, when public leaders announced that the United States was in Vietnam to save the people of South Vietnam from Communist aggression and to defend freedom and democracy, few challenged the accuracy of the claim or the necessity of the commitment. And when Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy said the struggle in Vietnam was required to prevent Communism from taking over one nation after another like tumbling dominoes until our own shores would be directly imperiled, that seemed not just a reasonable theory, but a frightening possibility. And the broad acceptance of Cold War policies was bolstered by the era&#x2019;s equally broad religiosity. The idea that the United States was engaged in a godly crusade against atheistic Communism was not an extreme position in the 1950s, but part of everyday discourse.</p><p>It was still unimaginable to most Americans that their own nation would wage aggressive war and justify it with unfounded claims, that it would support antidemocratic governments reviled by their own people, and that American troops would be sent to fight in countries where they were widely regarded not as liberators, but as imperialist invaders. Of course, there were cracks in the Cold War consensus even in the 1950s&#x2014;the emergence of a mass struggle for civil rights, new forms of dissenting art, literature, and music, early signs of a growing youth culture, and the critical perspectives of older left-wing activists and intellectuals whose challenges to state and corporate power dated back to the intense political struggles of the 1930s. Even so, it is hard today to recover a full sense of how effectively the dominant Cold War culture blanketed the nation with an uncritical acceptance of America&#x2019;s right and responsibility to intervene overseas.</p><p>But as the Vietnam War continued, year after year, that faith declined dramatically. Alarming evidence mounted that the United States was doing exactly the opposite of what its leaders claimed. Instead of saving South Vietnam, U.S. warfare was destroying it. South Vietnam was not an independent nation, but wholly dependent on American support. The United States did not make progress by amassing huge body counts of enemy killed, but only convinced more Vietnamese that it was a foreign aggressor. Prolonging the war did not preserve American credibility; it only did further damage to the nation&#x2019;s reputation.</p><p>As citizens came to reject their government&#x2019;s claims, many also shed the once commonplace assumption that Americans place a higher value on life than foreign foes. That faith was eviscerated by the vision of U.S. soldiers burning down the homes of Vietnamese peasants and forcing millions off their ancestral land; the incessant U.S. bombing, year after year, with nothing to show for it but further death and destruction; and the indelible images from My Lai, where an American company of infantrymen slaughtered five hundred unarmed, unresisting Vietnamese civilians.</p><p>By 1971, 58 percent of Americans had concluded that the war in Vietnam was not just a mistake, but immoral. More than at any time in our past, broad sections of the public, cutting across lines of class, gender, race, and religion, rejected the claim that American military power was an invincible force for good. Many concluded that the United States was as capable of wrongdoing as any nation or people, if not more so. And by 1973, when the final U.S. troops were withdrawn from Vietnam, only a third of Americans still trusted the government to do what was right.</p><p>Critics of the war were not the only ones whose faith in American exceptionalism was damaged or destroyed. Pro-war hawks were also disillusioned. They agonized over the U.S. failure in Vietnam. Why had the greatest military power in world history been unable or unwilling to prevail against a small, poor, agricultural people? What happened to the America that had rallied so magnificently to defeat Fascism in World War II? Had the protests and divisions of the 1960s forever destroyed our national will and patriotism? And how would the world ever respect us again knowing that we abandoned the Vietnamese government we had so long supported?</p><p>For the political right, defeat in Vietnam was an intense motivator. Conservatives were determined to rebuild everything they thought the war had destroyed&#x2014;American power, pride, prestige, and patriotism. Above all, they wanted to resuscitate a faith in American supremacy. Their restoration project was a key factor in the rightward movement of American culture and politics in the decades after Vietnam. It depended, in part, on efforts to redefine the political and moral meanings of the Vietnam War. Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 saying Vietnam had been a &#x201c;noble cause&#x201d;&#x2014;a war that should have been fought and could have been won.

The men and women from very different backgrounds-a Texan athlete with German roots, an upper-crust son of a French mother and a wealthy businessman, a dirt-poor Midwestern fly fisherman, an orphaned fashion designer, and a ravishingly beautiful female fencer-all answer the call of duty, but each for a secret reason of her or his own.

Strega Nona saves her seeds from last year's garden, rotates her crops to keep the soil "happy and strong," and, much to Big Anthony's chagrin, explains the importance of compost and manure in the planting process. But most importantly, she stresses the need to sow seeds in orderly rows, a step Big Anthony chooses to ignore. The results are two very different gardens, as depicted by dePaola's familiar transparent acrylic illustrations, with bumbling Big Anthony having much more produce than he can handle.

He laments that many children and adults are losing touch with the material objects that have nurtured human development for thousands of years. The objects are still here, but we seem to care less and know less about them. </p><p> In his presentations to groups, he often asks an audience member what he or she knows about the chair the person is sitting in. Few people know much more than whether it's made of wood, plastic, or metal. If we know little about how things are made, it's hard to remain connected to the world around us. </p><p> <i>Fewer, Better Things</i> explores the history of craft in its many forms, explaining how raw materials, tools, design, and technique come together to produce beauty and utility in handmade or manufactured items. Whether describing the implements used in a traditional Japanese tea ceremony, the use of woodworking tools, or the use of new fabrication technologies, Adamson writes expertly and lovingly about the aesthetics of objects, and the care and attention that goes into producing them. Reading this wise and elegant book is a truly transformative experience.</p></p><p><b>Glenn Adamson</b> is a senior scholar at the Yale Center for British Art and works across the fields of design, craft, and contemporary art. Until March 2016 he was the director of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York and has been head of research at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and curator at the Chipstone Foundation in Milwaukee. His books include <i>Art in the Making</i> (coauthored with Julia Bryan-Wilson) and <i>The Craft Reader</i>, among others. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.<p>"Inspiring . . . <i>Fewer, Better Things</i> is deeply personal, full of stories about Adamson&#x2019;s family that are by turns funny, eye-opening, and moving . . . Adamson invites readers to follow along on a series of thought experiments about the objects in our lives, our relationships to them, what they mean, and how we might go about distilling them so that our material footprint is greatly reduced. And this isn&#x2019;t just an exercise--the future of humanity might depend on it." - <i>Architectural Digest</i></p><p>"[Adamson] makes a powerful case for limiting our purchases to things (including food) that we find to be beautiful, meaningful, or useful." - <i>Psychology Today</i></p><p>"A powerful and personal account of the meaning and wonder of craft by one of its leading voices. Through a compelling mix of family lore and cultural history, Adamson explores the practice and purpose of craft with elegance and insight. As craft enjoys a well earned renaissance, this work explains why it matters and why more of us are realising it matters." - <i>Tristram Hunt, Director, Victoria and Albert Museum</i></p><p>"Genial and elegant writing . . . Combining elements of memoir, reportage, material history, and curatorial studies, <i>Fewer, Better Things </i>is an erudite but accessible global survey of the contemporary material landscape and how we can be better informed to shape it . . . For the design-inclined, <i>Fewer, Better Things </i>will sharpen the way you think about the world around you." - <i>Modern Magazine</i></p><p>"If we are to navigate out of our cluttered and over-accessorized worlds, we need the kind of critical thinking that <i>Fewer, Better Things</i> beautifully and succinctly delivers. Reflecting a lifetime of study on material intelligence, Glenn Adamson&#x2019;s remarkable book asks us to radically reconsider the objects we choose to surround ourselves with. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can see it becoming a manifesto for modern living." - <i>Alexander Langlands, author of CROEFT: AN INQUIRY INTO THE ORIGINS AND TRUE MEANING OF TRADITIONAL CRAFTS</i></p><p>"Rich with examples and stories of objects and their makers . . . Adamson&#x2019;s crafty enthusiasm is infectious." - <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Adamson, a former director of the Museum of Arts and Design in New York and author of several books on craft, views the suffering of the natural world through the prism of our increasingly tortured relationship with it." - <i>New York Review of Books</i></p><p>"In <i>Fewer, Better Things</i>, scholar and former museum curator Glenn Adamson inspires readers to reflect on the physical items they encounter . . . Adamson argues that objects cross cultural barriers . . . and provide a shared understanding of culture and history. By creating meaningful connections to objects, we can move towards a sustainable world where we surround ourselves with fewer, but better, things." - <i>Shelf Awareness</i></p><p>"[Adamson&#x2019;s] book will awaken those who have tuned out from their surroundings." - <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"This new attention to craft, to work done through some close contact between hand and thing, has been enriched by the publication of <i>The Craft Reader . . .</i> Even readers who think they're not interested in craft will be more engaged than they expected, if they give the anthology half a chance." - <i>Barry Schwabsky, The Nation on THE CRAFT READER</i></p><p>"At a time when technical skill has been widely dismissed or outsourced in the production of art, Glenn Adamson crucially adds an entire spectrum of hand-crafted objects to the creative history of the post-war era." - <i>Thomas Crow, Institute of Fine Arts, New York University on THINKING THROUGH CRAFT</i></p><p>"[Adamson] is the best writer on craft since Peter Dormer . . .

Pollan chose the books for the Modern Library Gardening series because, as he writes, &#x201c;these writers are some of the great talkers in the rich, provocative, and frequently uproarious conversation that, metaphorically at least, has been taking place over the back fence of our gardens at least since the time of Pliny.&#x201d;</p><h2>Houseboat Mystery (12) (The Boxcar Children Mysteries)</h2><p>Floating down a lazy river, Benny finds a blackmail scheme in progress.</p><p>Gertrude Chandler Warner was born in 1890 in Putnam, Connecticut, where she taught school and wrote The Boxcar Children because she had often imagined how delightful it would be to live in a caboose or freight car.

When we use the term &#x201c;natural science,&#x201d; don&#x2019;t we mean that we are dealing with human knowledge of nature? <br><br>Steiner worked and reworked his Rosicrucian cosmology to make it increasingly precise and accurate. <i>An Outline of Esoteric Science</i> is as vital and relevant now as it was when first published in 1910 and remains the most comprehensive and effective presentation of a spiritual alternative to contemporary, materialistic cosmologies and a strict Darwinian view of human nature and evolution.<br><br>In this foundational work of spiritual science, we see how the creation and evolution of humanity is embedded at the heart of the vast, invisible web of interacting cosmic beings, through whom the alchemical processes of cosmic evolution continue to evolve.

As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.<br><br><b>Clopper Almon,</b> a seasoned student of Anthroposophy, is a cofounder of the Rudolf Steiner Institute.

Anybody interested in Scottish history needs to read it' Andrew Marr, </b><i><b>Sunday Times</b></i><br><i></i><br><i></i>Eighteenth-century Scotland is famed for generating many of the enlightened ideas which helped to shape the modern world. But there was in the same period another side to the history of the nation. Many of Scotland's people were subjected to coercive and sometimes violent change, as traditional ways of life were overturned by the 'rational' exploitation of land use. The Scottish Clearances is a superb and highly original account of this sometimes terrible process, which changed the Lowland countryside forever, as it also did, more infamously, the old society of the Highlands.</p><p>Based on a vast array of original sources, this pioneering book is the first to chart this tumultuous saga in one volume, with due attention to evictions and loss of land in both north and south of the Highland line. In the process, old myths are exploded and familiar assumptions undermined. With many fascinating details and the sense of an epic human story, The Scottish Clearances is an evocative memorial to all whose lives were irreparably changed in the interests of economic efficiency.</p><p>This is a story of forced clearance, of the destruction of entire communities and of large-scale emigration. Some winners were able to adapt and exploit the new opportunities, but there were also others who lost everything. The clearances created the landscape of Scotland today, but it came at a huge price.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago: The Complete Cultural Handbook</h2><p><p>The road across northern Spain to Santiago de Compostela in the northwest was one of the three major Christian pilgrimage routes during the Middle Ages, leading pilgrims to the resting place of the Apostle St. James. Today, the system of trails and roads that made up the old pilgrimage route is the most popular long-distance trail in Europe, winding from the heights of the Pyrenees to the gently rolling fields and woods of Galicia. Hundreds of thousands of modern-day pilgrims, art lovers, historians, and adventurers retrace the road today, traveling through a stunningly varied landscape which contains some of the most extraordinary art and architecture in the western world. For any visitor, the Road to Santiago is a treasure trove of historical sites, rustic Spanish villages, churches and cathedrals, and religious art.</p><p>To fully appreciate the riches of this unique route, look no further than <i>The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago</i>, a fascinating step-by-step guide to the cultural history of the Road for pilgrims, hikers, and armchair travelers alike. Organized geographically, the book covers aspects of the terrain, places of interest, history, artistic monuments, and each town and village's historical relationship to the pilgrimage.</p><p>The authors have led five student treks along the Road, studying the art, architecture, and cultural sites of the pilgrimage road from southern France to Compostela. Their lectures, based on twenty-five years of pilgrimage scholarship and fieldwork, were the starting point for this handbook.</p></p><p><p><b>David M. Gitlitz </b>and <b>Linda Kay Davidson</b>, specialists in Hispanic studies at the University of Rhode Island, met on the Road on their first pilgrimage to Santiago in 1974. Davidson has written several scholarly works on the pilgrimage to Compostela with co-author Maryjane Dunn. Gitlitz is the author of various books on Hispanic and Sephardic culture, including the prize-winning <i>Secrecy and Deceit: The Religion of the Crypto-Jews</i>. Their first book written together, also from St. Martin's Press, was <i>A Drizzle of Honey: The Lives and Recipes of Spain's Secret Jews</i>, for which they won the National Jewish Book Award and the award for Distinguished Scholarship form the International Association of Culinary Professionals.</p>The Pilgrimage Road to Santiago <br> PART I The Road 1 . BORDER CANFRANC <i>Route:</i> Somport Candanch� Santa Cristina Canfranc Estaci�n La Torreta CANFRANC &nbsp; <br> &nbsp; <br> The central Pyrenees is a region of jutting peaks whose summits and upper slopes lie high above the tree lines. On the French side, north of the watershed axis, the valleys are wet, cold, and heavily forested. On the Spanish side, during the Pleistocene epoch massive glaciers scooped out U-shaped valleys perpendicular to the watershed divide, with lateral streams plummeting into the central valleys. The Spanish valleys drop rapidly into a much drier Mediterranean climate with markedly different vegetation: with each 200 m. of descent, 1 degree of mean annual temperature is gained, and several centimeters of annual precipitation are lost. The high valley walls all catch the winds and moisture and block the sunlight differentially, creating numerous microclimates. Overall, as you drop toward Jaca you will note a half dozen different ecosystems. Several types of oaks are found in the upper valleys. The slopes and edges of the valleys are dense with heath-type plants: gorse (spiny, low, evergreen shrubs with yellow flowers), bracken ferns, Spanish broom, and heather. Along the streambeds are willows and poplars, and in the lower valley are thick tangles of briar. From midvalley almost to Jaca are thickets of boxwood <i>(boj; bojerales).</i> You will also see increasing quantities of wild herbs, particularly lavender <i>(lavanda)</i> and thyme ( <i>tomillo</i>) <i>.</i> Along most of the descent, agricultural villages, spaced at 3- or 4-km. intervals, cling to small promontories or terraces that both offer protection and free up valuable bottomland for agriculture. The violent history of this region at the time the villages were established meant that there were almost no dispersed farmsteads. Instead, peasants clustered their homes and barns for protection and walked daily out to their fields. Most of the isolated buildings you will see are modern. <i></i> Somport The Somport pass ( <i>Summus portus</i>; 1,640 m.) has been the preferred Roman route across the central Pyrenees ever since Cato conquered the Jacetania tribes around Jaca in 195 B.C.E. This relatively easy corridor from Oloron, France, to Jaca has been favored by merchants, pilgrims, and invading armies over the centuries. In the 4th c. the Vandals invaded through this pass. A century later the Visigoths swept through. In the 8th c. ragtag bands of Christians defended these heights against the Muslim invaders from the south, struggling to keep them from spilling into France. The 16th-c. Hapsburg kings fortified the pass against anticipated French invasions, but these did not come until 1809, when Napoleon's Mariscal Suchet swept through here on his way to occupy Jaca. When General Espoz y Mina finally ousted the French in 1814, they retreated along this same road. And modern bunkers from the time of the Civil War (see ch. 24) can still be seen along every pinch point leading up to the pass. The pass also channeled most pilgrim traffic until the 12th c., when Navarran and Basque bandits were brought under control, making the much easier pass to the west through Roncesvalles safe. For most pilgrims, both medieval and modern, the entry into Spain was an emotional experience, for it meant that they had left their old lives behind and had reached the land of the Apostle. The breathtaking view of snowcapped peaks from the pass didn't hurt either. The pass is marked by the Ermita del Pilar, built in 1992, and a modern pedestal decorated with the cross of Santiago. At the border you are roughly 850 km. from Compostela. &nbsp; <br> <i></i> Candanch� (Camp d'Anjou). This was the camp established by the French Anjou dynasty that claimed sovereignty of the valley. At 1,560 m., today it thrives as a ski resort. Just below the town, on a spur of rock to the left of the highway, are scattered ruins of a castle erected early in the 13th c. for the protection of pilgrims. It was purchased by the king of Arag�n in 1293 and abandoned in 1458. From the ruins you can see the glaciers of Candanch� and Rioseta. Look here, too, for Civil War bunkers. The reddish conglomerate and sandstone La Raca cliffs on the east wall of the valley are fragments of the mountains that preceded the Pyrenees some 300 million years ago. To the south are the so-called interior mountains, recrystalized calcium deposits of the Devonian period, twisted by tectonic forces and dissolved and eroded by water in a karstic action that has created many caves. &nbsp; <br> <i></i> Santa Cristina The 12th-c. <i>Codex Calixtinus</i> (see ch. 16) in 1140 lauded the hospice of Santa Cristina--often referred to generically as simply El Hospital--as one of the world's 3 great pilgrim hospices: God has, in a most particular fashion, instituted in this world three columns greatly necessary for the support of his poor, that is to say, the hospice of Jerusalem, the hospice of Mount-Joux [a reference to San Bernardo, in the Swiss Alps], and the hospice of Santa Cristina on the Somport pass. [CC: Book V; trans. Melczer, 87] Tradition holds that the original hospice was built by 2 pilgrims lost in the snow who were led to shelter here by a white dove carrying a golden cross. Documents, on the other hand, show that its founding was due to the collaboration of 2 princes, King Sancho Ram�rez of Arag�n (who visited here in 1078) and Count Gast�n IV of Bearne, who died in 1130 while fighting the Muslims. Donations poured in, so that by mid-13th c. Santa Cristina owned some 14 churches in France and another 30 in Arag�n, including property in places as far afield as Tarazona,Calatayud, and Castej�n. Numerous kings and popes contributed to its maintenance. In return, Santa Cristina maintained a network of smaller hospices in all of the neighboring mountain passes. They all offered lodging, food, pasturage for the pilgrims' animals, an infirmary, and money-changing facilities. The hospice and priory of Santa Cristina prospered during the boom years of the pilgrimage. But in 1569 its community of monks was moved to Jaca at the request of the bishop, and in 1592 it was demolished and its stones used in building Jaca's new fortifications. The community maintained a small shelter for pilgrims during the summers until the 1835 general <i>desamortizaci�n.</i> Excavations in 1987-9 to the southeast of the Fuente de los Frailes revealed Santa Cristina's general ground plan, including a monastery, church, and a hospice measuring 25 x 13 m. Some 300 m. below the ruins are remnants of the Escarne Bridge, cited in documents dated 1586. &nbsp; <br> On the left, 2 km. before Canfranc Estaci�n at the Coll de Ladrones, are extensive late-19th-c. fortifications that incorporate a 1592 castle built as part of the defensive line anchored in Castiello de Jaca. The picturesque drawbridge and moat date from ca. 1900. By the bridge below the castle used to stand the Ermita de San Ant�n, completely demolished when the highway was built in 1888. &nbsp; <br> <i></i> Canfranc Estaci�n A railroad connecting Spain and France through a great Pyrenean tunnel was projected in 1853. But engineering difficulties and politics, particularly the fear of invasion from the north, slowed the project, and actual work did not begin until 1904. The railroad was not inaugurated until 1928. Except for wartime, service continued from then until 1970, when an accident on the bridge of L'Estanguet put an end to scheduled international service. As we write, the tunnels are being reconditioned for modern use. Canfranc Estaci�n is a town built both by and for the railroad. Its great esplanade was created with earth removed from the railroad tunnel, and the river was rechanneled to permit the esplanade's construction. The town's population swelled in 1944 when a disastrous fire devastated the ancient village of Canfranc, further down the valley. The boom ended when the trains stopped running, and the imposing railroad station was left to crumble to ruin. In the last few years Canfranc Estaci�n has found new life as a ski center. The reservoir and hydroelectric station below Canfranc Estaci�n were built--largely by manual labor--from 1957 to 1971. &nbsp; <br> Below Canfranc Estaci�n the valley sides are composed of sedimentary rocks from a 100-million-year-old sea. Pressures from the lifting of the Pyrenees folded the rocks spectacularly. The imposing mountains to the left are Anayet (2,545 m.), La Moleta (2,576 m.), and Collarada (2,886 m.) To the right rises the Pico de Aspe (2,645 m.). &nbsp; <br> <i></i> La Torreta This picturesque castle, also called the Torre de Fusileros and the Torreta de Espelunca, is an 1876 fortification built on the site of 16th- and 18th-c. forts. On our last visit for the first time we found it open, splendidly restored to become the Centro de Informaci�n del T�nel de Somport. THE PILGRIMAGE ROAD TO SANTIAGO: THE COMPLETE CULTURAL HANDBOOK.

There are many Benjamin Franklins. Or at least he has taken on many different forms in the history books and conversations of the last two centuries. Some historians have shown us an aged statesman whose wise and steadying influence kept the Constitutional Convention together in 1787, while others have pictured a chuckling prankster who couldn t resist a funny story. More recently, a certain brand of biographers and journalists have conjured up sensational tales of a lecherous old diplomat in his seventies who enjoyed illicit affairs with adoring young French women. And a few years ago Franklin even reappeared as a British spy! Some of these myths are now being repeated and embellished in school textbooks and educational television programs. Which of all these Benjamin Franklins, if any, is real? This book is an attempt to answer that question. Or, more accurately, it is an attempt to let Franklin himself provide the answer. The Real Benjamin Franklin makes no effort to develop another fresh interpretation of the Sage of Philadelphia. Instead, it seats us across the table from the one person who really knew Benjamin Franklin- -that is, Franklin himself- -and gives him an opportunity to explain his life and ideas in his own words. Part I of this book details his exciting biography, and Part II includes his most important and insightful writings. In both sections, Franklin s words are carefully documented from original sources. This volume is part of a series being published by the National Center for Constitutional Studies, a nonprofit educational foundation dedicated to restoring Constitutional principles in the tradition of America s Founding Fathers. The AMERICAN CLASSIC SERIES is designed to revive an intelligent appreciation of the Founders and the remarkable system of free government which they gave us.</p><h2>Why Can&#39;t I Get Better? Solving the Mystery of Lyme and Chronic Disease: Solving the Mystery of Lyme and Chronic Disease</h2><p><p><b>From one of the country's foremost doctors comes a ground-breaking book about diagnosing, treating and healing Lyme, and peeling away the layers that lead to chronic disease.</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>You may not know that you have Lyme. It can mimic every disease process including Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Fibromyalgia, autoimmune conditions like MS, psychiatric conditions like depression and anxiety, and cause significant memory and concentration problems, mimicking early dementia. It is called the "Great Imitator," and inaccurate testing-combined with a fierce, ongoing debate that questions chronic infection-makes it difficult for sufferers to find effective care.</p><p>When Dr. Richard Horowitz moved to the Hudson Valley over two decades ago to start his own medical practice, he had no idea that he was jumping into a hotbed of Lyme disease. He would soon realize that many of the chronic disease diagnoses people were receiving were also the result of Lyme-and he would discover how once-treatable infections, in the absence of timely intervention, could cause disabling conditions. In a field where the number of cases is growing exponentially around the world and answers remain elusive, Dr. Horowitz has treated over 12,000 patients and made extraordinary progress. His plan represents a crucial paradigm shift, without which the suffering will continue.</p><p>In this book, Dr. Horowitz:</p><p> - Breaks new ground with a 16 Point Differential Diagnostic Map, the basis for his revolutionary Lyme treatment plan, and an overarching approach to treating all chronic illness.</p><p> - Introduces MSIDS, or Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome, a new lens on chronic illness that may prove to be an important missing link.</p><p> - Covers in detail Lyme's leading symptoms and co-infections, including immune dysfunction, sleep disorders, chronic pain and neurodegenerative disorders - pro�viding a unique functional and integrative health care model, based on the most up-to-date scientific research, for physicians and health care providers to effectively treat Lyme and other chronic illnesses.</p><p>Cutting through the frustration, misinformation and endless questions, Dr. Horowitz's enlightening story of medical discovery, science and politics is an all-in-one source for patients of chronic illness to identify their own symptoms and work with their doctors for the best possible treatment outcome.</p></p><p>RICHARD I. HOROWITZ is a board-certified MD specializing in Internal Medicine. He and his wife, Lee, founded the Hudson Valley Healing Arts Center in Hyde Park, New York, which has treated over 12,000 patients for tick-borne diseases over the past twenty-six years. Dr. Horowitz is known for his pioneering work with Lyme disease and is recognized to be one of the country&#39;s foremost experts on chronic illness.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>Identifying Lyme Disease <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>The History of Medicine: <br>2000 BCE: <i>Here, eat this root. It will make you strong.</i> <br>1080 BCE: <i>Throw out that root and drink this potion; it is better for you.</i> <br>250 AD: <i>Get rid of that potion; it is bad for you. Take this herb instead.</i> <br>1910: <i>Get rid of this herb and take this potion; it is more effective.</i> <br>1950: <i>That potion is bad for you; here, take this drug.</i> <br>2000: <i>That drug is no longer effective; here, eat this root.</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>How is it possible that an epidemic of tick-borne diseases could be spreading without getting the proper attention? How could patients throughout the United States continue to be desperate for help? To understand the answer to this dilemma, you need to understand the intricacies of Lyme disease and the constructs of the medical paradigm that doctors and health authorities work under. <br>First of all, we must look at the history of medicine. Medicine is a continuously changing and expanding field, and it is said that almost half of everything that we learn in medical school will usually be proven to be wrong every five to ten years. There are numerous examples of the undeniable blessings of modern medicine: antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals; new high-tech diagnostic machines and tests; groundbreaking surgeries; and public health initiatives have extended human life (most especially in infancy) and increased well-being in the general population. But along the way to modern medicine, some medical pioneers have been dismissed or even attacked for what others believed were their heretical ideas. <br>For example, consider Dr. Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, a nineteenth-century Hungarian physician, who is now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures described as the &#x201c;savior of mothers.&#x201d; Semmelweis made an important scientific observation: When he washed his hands before delivering babies, the women in his clinic did not die as often from puerperal sepsis (a bacterial infection that kills women shortly after giving birth) as those in another clinic in the same hospital, which had a death rate of 10 percent. When he shared this important observation with his colleagues, he was ridiculed. As patients abandoned his colleagues and begged to deliver in his clinic, he was ostracized by his medical society and driven out of medicine. He was committed to an asylum, where ironically, he died of septicemia only fourteen days later, possibly the result of being severely beaten by his guards. <br>Dr. Louis Pasteur was another example of a scientist who was ridiculed. It was years before his theory of the germ origins of illness was proven to be correct. <br> <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> were first discovered in the stomachs of patients with gastritis and stomach ulcers in 1982 by Australian doctors Barry Marshall and Robin Warren. The conventional thinking at the time of their research was that no bacterium could live in the strong acid environment of the human stomach. They also proposed that treatment with antibiotics rather than the practices then in use, which included stomach removal, were best for ulcer patients. Their discovery was ignored for almost twenty years, while patients had their stomachs removed because of bleeding ulcers, or were told to drink large quantities of milk, or were cautioned that their ulcers were due to stress alone. <br>There is a long list of other examples available for anyone who wants to explore the history of medicine. Many of these pioneers pushed the boundaries until the paradigm of that specific disease process was transformed. Are things different today? Have we learned to listen to those challenging the medical establishment? Certainly not with respect to Lyme disease and associated tick-borne disorders. <br>To understand Lyme disease, we need to go back to the mid 1970s, when portrait painter Polly Murray first noticed an outbreak of what had been called &#x201c;juvenile rheumatoid arthritis&#x201d; in the town of Lyme, Connecticut, that had affected her and her children from decades earlier. Dr. Alan Steere, a rheumatologist at Yale University, was called in to investigate the epidemic, as were researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Rocky Mountain Labs. Dr. Willy Burgdorfer, a researcher at Rocky Mountain Labs, identified a microscopic spirochete, a spiral-shaped bacteria that resembles the one that causes syphilis. This was eventually identified as the causative agent of the newly identified disease, and the spirochete was named <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> (Bb) after Dr. Burgdofer&#x2019;s discovery, and the related disease was called Lyme, after its initial outbreak in the town of Lyme, Connecticut. <br>Although patients may have had other manifestations of the disease, Dr. Allan Steere primarily investigated patients with rashes and rheumatologic manifestations, including hot, swollen joints, for the Connecticut Department of Public Health. He was instrumental in determining that many became ill in summer or early fall and lived in geographic clusters in mostly rural areas. He did recognize that patients were very ill and not just psychologically disturbed. But what caused this mysterious illness? <br>This mysterious illness was actually not a new discovery at all. Lyme disease had already been reported in Europe in the late 1800s, as a rash of the hands: Dr. Alfred Buchwald described a skin lesion; others in Europe and the United States reported the same lesion as part of a condition called Bannwarth syndrome, a triad of radiculitis (a pain radiating along a nerve), with Bell&#x2019;s palsy (the sudden onset of facial paralysis), and meningitis (an inflammation occurring in the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). In 1909, Dr. Arvid Afzelius described an expanding ring-like skin rash, later named erythema chronicum migrans, or ECM (in 1990, dermatologist Dr. Bernard Berger recognized that the rash was not chronic in all cases and renamed it <i>Erythema Migrans</i> or, simply, EM). Ten years later, Afzelius connected the disease with joint problems and speculated that they are somehow related to the bite of a tick. In 1922 the disease was found to be associated with neurological problems, and in 1930 the diagnosis further included psychiatric disturbances. A few years later, arthritic problems were added. In 1965 Dr. Sidney Robbin, a semiretired internist living in Montauk, New York, described expanding circular rashes that responded to penicillin treatment that appeared in conjunction with a peculiar type of arthritis that he named Montauk knee. Five years later, Dr. Rudolph Scrimenti, a Wisconsin dermatologist, published the first report of an ECM rash in the United States. As Dr. Robbin had observed, he too reported that the rash responded to penicillin. <br>No one, however, had put all the pieces together. And no one yet connected these symptoms to the patients who were so ill in rural Connecticut. Was this a new illness, and, if so, where did it come from and how should we treat it? By 1977, Dr. Steere was reporting a whole host of specific and often bizarre signs of this new disease, including fever, fatigue, headache, migratory joint pains, as well as multiple cardiovascular and neurological abnormalities. As the result of treating patients with antibiotics for (only) seven to ten days, many patients went on to develop other symptoms. It appeared that antibiotics just wouldn&#x2019;t help Lyme patients. Perhaps Lyme was caused by a virus, or was an autoimmune disorder. <br>When you have been trained in a particular medical specialty, you see the world through certain lenses and diagnostic paradigms. A gastroenterologist, for example, sees the world through the lens of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and tries to link up a patient&#x2019;s symptoms to diseases known in their specialty. This is the same for neurology or infectious disease or, in the case of Dr. Steere, a rheumatologist, for diseases of the joints, which include autoimmune diseases. It is not that the thinking of these doctors and subspecialists is necessarily wrong, but it may be that their worldview only includes part of the whole picture. There is relative truth, and then there is absolute truth. When the three blind men are feeling the elephant, they each describe a different part. One describes the elephant as having a long, movable nose, another tough skin with thick legs and big nails, and the third might just describe a thin, coarse tail. Each has described a certain relative truth, and none is incorrect, but none of them have seen the big picture: It&#x2019;s an elephant! <br>So it is with Lyme disease. The initial paradigm created for diagnosis and treatment of these patients was through a rheumatologist&#x2019;s narrowly focused eyes. Soon the infectious disease doctors claimed Lyme disease as part of their turf. <br>I was trained as an internist to be a medical detective, with a wide diagnostic perspective: We have to know something about all of the medical subspecialties. The vision of an internist must be broad and inclusive of all possibilities, since his or her job is to diagnose patients to effectively determine who needs to be referred to subspecialists. An internist, therefore, will not necessarily have some of the inherent biases or diagnostic schema associated with subspecialists. As Lyme diagnosis and treatment fell into the domains of the rheumatologists and infectious disease doctors early on, a paradigm was forming based on the way these subspecialists viewed the world. In addition, traditional medical education has always taught doctors to find one cause for all of the patient&#x2019;s symptoms. This is deeply ingrained in every physician&#x2019;s education. We generally are not taught to look for multifactorial causes of an illness. Therefore, if a Lyme disease patient presents with thirty-five different symptoms, the established paradigm would be to try and explain these complaints according to the accepted medical model: one primary diagnosis. If the doctor could not find a single etiology, or cause, for your symptoms, it must be because it is psychological in nature, and you are crazy. Or the answer might be elusive because the symptoms can&#x2019;t be understood in the HMO-dictated fifteen-minute time frame. Or perhaps the physician hasn&#x2019;t looked hard enough, or just sees the world through one narrow diagnostic lens. <br>Let&#x2019;s embark on a journey together as medical detectives to see how we might diagnose and treat one of the most pressing epidemics facing us in the twenty-first century. <br>GETTING TO THE SOURCE OF CHRONIC ILLNESS <br>Although solving such an enormous problem like multiple systemic infectious disease syndrome (MSIDS) might seem a very daunting, or even an unreachable, goal, as a physician I have found that communicating well with my patients is a key ingredient. Searching for clues by listening intently to their symptoms allows even the most seriously ill multisystem-affected patient to achieve greater health and wellness. After accumulating all of the necessary information from the patient, and reviewing the laboratory results, we need to blend medical knowledge with deeper intuitive wisdom. <br>Tell me again: What do you feel? When did it begin? What makes it better or worse? As I probe each time, their stories prompt me to search for new clues: The mystery unfolds through our dialogue. Of course, this technique doesn&#x2019;t ensure that we can discover the answers for all the problems of all our patients all the time. Nor does it mean that this strategy will cure illnesses that have plagued patients for years (although this might be possible). But it does allow the medical detective to register some clue that hadn&#x2019;t seemed important before. <br>The second piece of the strategy of being an insightful medical detective is attitude. And by this I mean developing a strong desire to benefit the patient who is suffering. We can achieve this by imagining exchanging ourselves with another and doing for them exactly what we would want done for ourselves. Rather than take an all-knowing physician stance, I believe the best medical strategy is developing a strong and unwavering compassion for others. Any success I have had in my practice rests on this guiding principle. Although this might sound like a new credo for modern medicine, it is, in fact, implied in the Hippocratic Oath that all physicians take. It has doctors pledge respect for human life, and to treat patients as fellow human beings, not medical conditions. <br>Adopting compassion as the foundation of our health-care system challenges the time-efficient models and financial incentive&#x2013;driven perspectives of modern health care. Yet many patients, physicians, and insurance directors are unhappy with our current health-care system. Even patients with health insurance coverage suffer with chronic undiagnosed illnesses, physicians burn out, and health-care costs continue to soar in this unhealthy atmosphere. It is difficult to find satisfaction as a physician if you are rushing from patient to patient and are unable to find the time to develop a strong, heart-centered healing partnership with those who seek your care. Shifting from the head to the heart, where our compassion lies, can bring patients and physicians greater satisfaction, and it provides the essential motivation to get to the root cause of illness. This ultimately benefits the patient, the health-care system (as unnecessary and expensive tests are not performed), and the physician (as he or she experiences greater satisfaction and improved patient outcomes). <br>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes that chronic illness may be a complex interplay of genetics, environmental factors, infections, and trauma. But in day-to-day practice, doctors often do not use this broad framework to understand and treat chronic illness. Usually, the HMO model encourages limited time for visits and referring patients to long lists of specialists who, if they get approval, will perform long lists of expensive tests. Yet these same insurance companies often place limits on medically necessary treatment options for economic reasons. Few physicians have the time to uncover the multifactorial causes of chronic illness. Most specialists are trained only to treat one small piece of the puzzle, one body system, or one category of causes. <br>I believe that the first piece of this paradigm shift must therefore be with primary care physicians. These first-line physicians must use a broader and more inclusive framework to break down chronic illness into layers by examining the mental, emotional, and physical aspects of each illness. <br>Then we must go even further as detectives and break these physical symptoms down into the anatomy of an illness, the biology of an illness, the biochemistry of an illness, the immunology of an illness, and the genetics behind the illness. Functional medicine and abnormalities in the biochemical pathways that drive chronic illness are a start. These often need to be examined to discover clues as to why the chronically ill patient has persistent symptoms. In medical school, doctors are not taught adequately about environmental medicine nor is the importance of what these toxins may do to the body emphasized, or how detoxification pathways work, how inflammatory cytokines (the protein molecules that are secreted by cells that can communicate with each other) cause sickness behavior, or how mental or emotional stress can negatively affect adrenal function, causing immune system dysfunction. <br>Physicians are trained to recognize and treat chronic infections, but many believe that the list of chronic diseases is limited to those like tuberculosis, leprosy, syphilis, chronic Q fever, or chronic viral infections...</p><h2>The Violinist&#39;s Thumb: And Other Lost Tales of Love, War, and Genius, as Written by Our Genetic Code</h2><p><strong>From <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author Sam Kean comes incredible stories of science, history, language, and music, as told by our own DNA. </strong><br><br>In <i>The Disappearing Spoon</i>, bestselling author Sam Kean unlocked the mysteries of the periodic table.

Genes illuminate everything from JFK's bronze skin (it wasn't a tan) to Einstein's genius. They prove that Neanderthals and humans bred thousands of years more recently than any of us would feel comfortable thinking. They can even allow some people, because of the exceptional flexibility of their thumbs and fingers, to become truly singular violinists.<br><br>Kean's vibrant storytelling once again makes science entertaining, explaining human history and whimsy while showing how DNA will influence our species' future.<br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, July 2012</strong>: Born to parents named Gene and Jean, Sam Kean got enough ribbing in school science classes to develop an early aversion to genetics. Lucky for us, curiosity overcame conditioning as he became increasingly fascinated with the role DNA plays in shaping destiny. As he did in <em>The Disappearing Spoon</em>, a captivating chronicle of human interactions with each periodic element, Kean has created another page-turning scientific history in <em>The Violinist&#x2019;s Thumb</em>. With fluid gusto, he turns the discovery of DNA into riveting human drama, then unfurls a series of anecdotes that expand our understanding of genetic influence on our lives as (sometimes uniquely gifted) individuals, from presidents to physicists to violin virtuosos with exceptionally dexterous digits. Kean illuminates clues embedded in our genes that help map the meandering trajectory of our species, then leaves readers with the distinct impression that all this has been a fantastic preamble to our species&#x2019; most thrilling (and likely chilling) chapter: manipulating our DNA to remake future humans, and all life on Earth. --<em>Mari Malcolm</em>Sam Kean is the author of the New York Times bestseller The Disappearing Spoon.

Wallace</h2><p>Culver, former US senator and representative, and journalist Hyde note the paradox that Wallace (1885-1965) was the son of prominent midwestern Republicans but became the emblematic leftist politician of his time. They portray him as an agriculturalist of international renown, a prolific author, groundbreaking economist, successful businessman, and shy politician. They place him in the social and political milieu of turn-of-the-century Iowa and of Washington politics between the wars. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>John C. Culver is a former U.S. senator from Iowa. John Hyde is a former reporter for the Des Moines Register."A warm and comprehensive account of a remarkable public servant, with an especially revealing narrative about his rise and fall as Vice President, and his gallant but doomed candidacy for President as a progressive. A fine contribution to twentieth-century American history. -- <i>James MacGregor Burns, author of <i>Dead Center: Clinton-Gore Leadership and the Perils of Moderation</i></i><br><br>"In this masterly work, Culver and Hyde have captured one of the more fascinating figures in American history. <i>American Dreamer</i> is a wonderful tale of the rich and varied life of a good man whose rightful place in history is now assured." -- <i>Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of <i>No Ordinary Time</i></i><br><br>A formidable achievement. . . . Culver and Hyde remind us that once upon a time an eminently decent and brilliant man almost made it to the White House. In this engrossing account of a rich life, Henry Wallace emerges as a forgotten hero of our bloody and wretched century. -- <i>Kai Bird, author of <i>The Color of Truth: McGeorge Bundy &amp; William Bundy, Brothers in Arms</i></i><br><br>At long last a lucid, balanced and judicious narrative of Henry Wallace of Iowa: America's colorful agrarian idealist. We owe John C. Culver and John Hyde our deep gratitude for reclaiming this remarkable man-who served as FDR's vice president during World War II and was Truman's liberal Cold War nemesis-for posterity. <i>American Dreamer</i> is a first-rate biography. -- <i>Douglas Brinkley, co-author of <i>Witness to America</i> and author of <i>The Unfinished Presidency: Jimmy Carter's Journey Beyond the White House</i></i><br><br>Henry A. Wallace has at last found his biographers. John Culver and John Hyde have brought us a fascinating, thoughtful, incisive and well-researched life of the mysterious and complicated figure who might have become President at the moment when World War II was about to give way to the Cold War and who then championed one of the most important third-party movements in American history. -- <i>Michael Beschloss, author of <i>Taking Charge: The Johnson White House Tapes, 1963-1964</i></i><br><br>Henry Wallace was an American original. Culver and Hyde have faithfully reconstructed the record of this uncommon man whose life partly shaped our century. Everyone interested in twentieth-century American history will want to read this book. -- <i>Robert Dallek, author of <i>Flawed Giant</i></i><br><br>In this eminently readable biography, John C. Culver and John Hyde have put together a captivating chronicle of American politics from the Depression through the 1960s. The remarkable life of Henry Wallace is one of the most profound and extraordinary chapters in the history of American liberalism. Many of the dramatic scenes so vividly painted by Culver and Hyde will make you feel you're there in person. <i>American Dreamer</i> is a fascinating narrative that deserves to be read by all who care about the American Dream. -- <i>Senator Edward M. Kennedy</i><br><br>Roosevelt alone excepted, Henry Wallace was the most interesting and in many ways the most effective of all New Dealers. . . . Under Wallace as Secretary, the Department of Agriculture became the economic and political focus of the New Deal. . . .

It truly holds one's attention from beginning to end. -- <i>John Kenneth Galbraith</i><br><br>This is a great book about a great man. I can't recall when--if ever--I've read a better biography. -- <i>George McGovern</i><br><br>This is the most balanced, complete, and readable account of a figure who transformed agriculture world wide and (in part as Vice President of the United States) tried to transform US politics and foreign policy. Its publication is nicely timed: just as Americans celebrate 'the middle way' at home and triumphalism abroad, they are reminded of this different, colorful person who committed himself to Roosevelt's New Deal, the Progressive Party in 1948, and-for a pivotal time-searching for an alternative to a Cold War he believed would be long and bloody. -- <i>Walter LaFeber, author of <i>Inevitable Revolutions</i></i></p><h2>Death of an Addict (Hamish Macbeth Mysteries, No. 15)</h2><p>The return of Constable Hamish Macbeth finds Hamish going undercover to investigate the mysterious death of a recovered heroin addict, whose church has been suspected of being in the drug trade. 18,000 first printing.</p><p>M.C. Beaton's Hamish Macbeth doesn't fit everyone's idea of a cozy mystery hero. The police constable prefers his flock of Highland sheep and fine single-malt Scotch to cats and cups of tea, and the details of his success with women would bring a maidenly blush to Miss Marple's cheek. Yet his charm is definitely of the soft-boiled variety. <i>Death of an Addict</i>, Beaton's 15th book in this series, begins with the apparent overdose death of Tommy Jarret, a recovering heroin addict who was writing an autobiography. Hamish, who oversees law and order in the village of Lochdubh, is instantly suspicious of the circumstances. Told to back off the case, he picks it up again on the sly when the dead man's parents ask him to find out what happened. Hamish's apparent lack of ambition masks a keen nose for illegal activity; even the dead ends of his investigation reveal a loan-sharking operation and a cache of hallucinogenic mushrooms.<p> Hamish's biggest fish is drug baron Jimmy White. To reel White in, Hamish poses as a drug supplier, with a beautiful, standoffish detective inspector from Glasgow playing the part of his wife. The pair go off on a whirlwind trip to Amsterdam to maintain their front, leading to a comic mishap and the beginnings of a romance--one that nearly comes to a very bad end when White is tipped off by Hamish's enemy, Detective Inspector Blair. </p><p> Mystery buffs new to the series will find this Highland fling easy to follow, and those who are already fans will delight in the hint of a new long-term relationship for their laconic hero. <i>--Barrie Trinkle</i></p>M.

Five months later, the Endurance - just a day's sail short of its destination - became locked in an island of ice, and its destiny and men became locked in history. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted until it was finally crushed, and Shackleton and his crew made an 850-mile journey in a 20-foot craft through the South Atlantic's worst seas to reach an outpost of civilization. Inspired by the ordeal that Time magazine said "defined heroism," author Alfred Lansing conducted interviews with the crew's surviving members and pored over diaries and personal accounts to create his best-selling book on the miraculous voyage. In Audio Partners' abridged recording of <i>Endurance</i>, reader Patrick Malahide renders a masterful portrayal of these courageous men.</p><p>In the summer of 1914, Sir Ernest Shackleton set off aboard the <i>Endurance</i> bound for the South Atlantic. The goal of his expedition was to cross the Antarctic overland, but more than a year later, and still half a continent away from the intended base, the <i>Endurance</i> was trapped in ice and eventually was crushed. For five months Shackleton and his crew survived on drifting ice packs in one of the most savage regions of the world before they were finally able to set sail again in one of the ship's lifeboats. Alfred Lansing's <i>Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage</i> is a white-knuckle account of this astounding odyssey. <p>Through the diaries of team members and interviews with survivors, Lansing reconstructs the months of terror and hardship the <i>Endurance</i> crew suffered. In October of 1915, there "were no helicopters, no Weasels, no Sno-Cats, no suitable planes. Thus their plight was naked and terrifying in its simplicity. If they were to get out--they had to get themselves out." How Shackleton did indeed get them out without the loss of a single life is at the heart of Lansing's magnificent true-life adventure tale.</p>'A superb account of the greatest survival story of our time' - Chris Bonington The story of Ernest Shackleton's epic journey to cross the Antarctic overland has now been turned into four hours of gripping television with Kenneth Branagh playing Shackleton. <p>Shackleton's mission failed, but the resulting adventure became one of the most celebrated accounts of man's survival against unbelievable odds. </p><p>In August 1914 the Endurance set sail for the South Atlantic. In October 1915, still half a continent away from their objective, the ship was trapped, then crushed in the ice. Twelve hundred miles away from land, drifting on ice packs, Shackleton and his men survived the next five months on a diet of dogs, penguins and seals. When the ship eventually sank they were forced to escape by lifeboat. Shackleton then travelled another 850 miles in an open boat across the stormiest ocean in the world to reach help. Every single man got home safely. </p><p>Miraculously, throughout this ordeal, the expedition's photographer, Frank Hurley, protected his negatives and photographs from destruction. It is these extraordinary photographs that are among those produced in this illustrated edition of Alfred Lansing's harrowing and inspiring classic.</p></p><h2>The Usborne First Thousand Words in Spanish: With Easy Pronunciation Guide (First Picture Book) (Spanish and English Edition)</h2><p>This book has large pictures for looking and talking, surrounded by small, labelled pictures of 1000 of the most familiar things, to build up and practice Spanish v ocabulary.

Daniel Dennett, whose previous books include <i>Brainstorms </i>and (with Douglas Hofstadter) <i>The Mind's I,</i> tackles the free will problem in a highly original and witty manner, drawing on the theories and concepts of several fields usually ignored by philosophers; not just physics and evolutionary biology, but engineering, automata theory, and artificial intelligence. </p><p>In <i>Elbow Room</i>, Dennett shows how the classical formulations of the problem in philosophy depend on misuses of imagination, and he disentangles the philosophical problems of real interest from the "family of anxieties' they get enmeshed in - imaginary agents, bogeymen, and dire prospects that seem to threaten our freedom. Putting sociobiology in its rightful place, he concludes that we can have free will and science too. <i>Elbow Room</i> begins by showing how we can be "moved by reasons" without being exempt from physical causation. It goes on to analyze concepts of control and self-control-concepts often skimped by philosophers but which are central to the questions of free will and determinism. A chapter on "self-made selves" discusses the idea of self or agent to see how it can be kept from disappearing under the onslaught of science. Dennett then sees what can be made of the notion of acting under the idea of freedomdoes the elbow room we think we have really exist? What is an opportunity, and how can anything in our futures be "up to us"? He investigates the meaning of "can" and "could have done otherwise," and asks why we want free will in the first place.We are wise, Dennett notes, to want free will, but that in itself raises a host of questions about responsibility. In a final chapter, he takes up the problem of how anyone can ever be guilty, and what the rationale is for holding people responsible and even, on occasion, punishing them.</p><p><i>Elbow Room </i>is an expanded version of the John Locke Lectures which Dennett gave at Oxford University in 1983.</p></p><p>Daniel C. Dennett is University Professor Codirector of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He is the author of <i>Brainchildren: Essays on Designing Minds</i>; <i>Sweet Dreams: Philosophical Obstacles to a Science of Consciousness</i>; <i>Elbow Room</i>: T<i>he Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting</i>; <i>Sweet Dreams: Philosophical Obstacles to a Science of Consciousness </i>(all published by the MIT Press),<i> From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Mind</i>, and other books.<p>Once again Daniel Dennett has made a stunning contribution to our achieving a monist physicalism which is compatible with human experiences. Just as his funtional mind-brain identity theory enable us to avoid positing 'grandmother neurons', so his new analysis enables psychologist to understand the competitive advantage of those species that believe they have free will and the stupidity of teaching introductory psychology students that they have none. A readable, light hearted book on a very serious subject. While philosphy citations outnumber those to psychology about two to one, Dennett is both well read and subtley competent in psychology, and the book will be enjoyed by intellecutal psychology students fully as much as by philosophy majors.</p>&#x2015;<b>Donald T.

One of my PowerPoint slides read: "Is God a mathematician?" As soon as that slide appeared, I heard a student in the front row gasp: "Oh God, I hope not!" </p><p> My rhetorical question was neither a philosophical attempt to define God for my audience nor a shrewd scheme to intimidate the math phobics. Rather, I was simply presenting a mystery with which some of the most original minds have struggled for centuries -- the apparent omnipresence and omnipotent powers of mathematics. These are the type of characteristics one normally associates only with a deity. As the British physicist James Jeans (1877-1946) once put it: "The universe appears to have been designed by a pure mathematician." Mathematics appears to be almost too effective in describing and explaining not only the cosmos at large, but even some of the most chaotic of human enterprises. </p><p> Whether physicists are attempting to formulate theories of the universe, stock market analysts are scratching their heads to predict the next market crash, neurobiologists are constructing models of brain function, or military intelligence statisticians are trying to optimize resource allocation, they are all using mathematics. Furthermore, even though they may be applying formalisms developed in different branches of mathematics, they are still referring to the same global, coherent mathematics. What is it that gives mathematics such incredible powers? Or, as Einstein once wondered: "How is it possible that mathematics, a product of human thought that is <i>independent of experience</i> [the emphasis is mine], fits so excellently the objects of physical reality?" </p><p> This sense of utter bewilderment is not new. Some of the philosophers in ancient Greece, Pythagoras and Plato in particular, were already in awe of the apparent ability of mathematics to shape and guide the universe, while existing, as it seemed, above the powers of humans to alter, direct, or influence it. The English political philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) could not hide his admiration either. In <i>Leviathan,</i> Hobbes's impressive exposition of what he regarded as the foundation of society and government, he singled out geometry as the paradigm of rational argument: </p><p> </p><blockquote> Seeing then that truth consisteth in the right ordering of names in our affirmations, a man that seeketh precise truth had need to remember what every name he uses stands for, and to place it accordingly; or else he will find himself entangled in words, as a bird in lime twigs; the more he struggles, the more belimed. And therefore in geometry (which is the only science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow on mankind), men begin at settling the significations of their words; which settling of significations, they call definitions, and place them in the beginning of their reckoning. </blockquote> <p> Millennia of impressive mathematical research and erudite philosophical speculation have done relatively little to shed light on the enigma of the power of mathematics. If anything, the mystery has in some sense even deepened. Renowned Oxford mathematical physicist Roger Penrose, for instance, now perceives not just a single, but a triple mystery. Penrose identifies three different "worlds": the <i>world of our conscious perceptions, the physical world,</i> and the <i>Platonic world of mathematical forms.</i> The first world is the home of all of our mental images -- how we perceive the faces of our children, how we enjoy a breathtaking sunset, or how we react to the horrifying images of war. This is also the world that contains love, jealousy, and prejudices, as well as our perception of music, of the smells of food, and of fear. The second world is the one we normally refer to as physical reality. Real flowers, aspirin tablets, white clouds, and jet airplanes reside in this world, as do galaxies, planets, atoms, baboon hearts, and human brains. The Platonic world of mathematical forms, which to Penrose has an actual reality comparable to that of the physical and the mental worlds, is the motherland of mathematics. This is where you will find the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,..., all the shapes and theorems of Euclidean geometry, Newton's laws of motion, string theory, catastrophe theory, and mathematical models of stock market behavior. And now, Penrose observes, come the three mysteries. First, the world of physical reality seems to obey laws that actually reside in the world of mathematical forms. This was the puzzle that left Einstein perplexed. Physics Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner (1902-95) was equally dumbfounded: </p><p> </p><blockquote> The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics to the formulation of the laws of physics is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve. We should be grateful for it and hope that it will remain valid in future research and that it will extend, for better or worse, to our pleasure, even though perhaps also to our bafflement, to wide branches of learning. </blockquote> <p> Second, the perceiving minds themselves -- the dwelling of our conscious perceptions -- somehow managed to emerge from the physical world. How was <i>mind</i> literally born out of <i>matter?</i> Would we ever be able to formulate a theory of the workings of consciousness that would be as coherent and as convincing as, say, our current theory of electromagnetism? Finally, the circle is mysteriously closed. Those perceiving minds were miraculously able to gain access to the mathematical world by discovering or creating and articulating a treasury of abstract mathematical forms and concepts. </p><p> Penrose does not offer an explanation for any of the three mysteries. Rather, he laconically concludes: "No doubt there are not really three worlds but <i>one,</i> the true nature of which we do not even glimpse at present." This is a much more humble admission than the response of the schoolmaster in the play <i>Forty Years On</i> (written by the English author Alan Bennett) to a somewhat similar question: </p><p> </p><blockquote> Foster: I'm still a bit hazy about the Trinity, sir. <p> Schoolmaster: Three in one, one in three, perfectly straightforward. Any doubts about that see your maths master. </p></blockquote> <p> The puzzle is even more entangled than I have just indicated. There are actually two sides to the success of mathematics in explaining the world around us (a success that Wigner dubbed "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics"), one more astonishing than the other. First, there is an aspect one might call "active." When physicists wander through nature's labyrinth, they light their way by mathematics -- the tools they use and develop, the models they construct, and the explanations they conjure are all mathematical in nature. This, on the face of it, is a miracle in itself. Newton observed a falling apple, the Moon, and tides on the beaches (I'm not even sure if he ever saw those!), not mathematical equations. Yet he was somehow able to extract from all of these natural phenomena, clear, concise, and unbelievably accurate mathematical laws of nature. Similarly, when the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79) extended the framework of classical physics to include <i>all</i> the electric and magnetic phenomena that were known in the 1860s, he did so by means of just four mathematical equations. Think about this for a moment. The explanation of a collection of experimental results in electromagnetism and light, which had previously taken volumes to describe, was reduced to four succinct equations. Einstein's general relativity is even more astounding -- it is a perfect example of an extraordinarily precise, self-consistent mathematical theory of something as fundamental as the structure of space and time. </p><p> But there is also a "passive" side to the mysterious effectiveness of mathematics, and it is so surprising that the "active" aspect pales by comparison. Concepts and relations explored by mathematicians only for pure reasons -- with absolutely no application in mind -- turn out decades (or sometimes centuries) later to be the unexpected solutions to problems grounded in physical reality! How is that possible? Take for instance the somewhat amusing case of the eccentric British mathematician Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877-1947). Hardy was so proud of the fact that his work consisted of nothing but pure mathematics that he emphatically declared: "No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make, directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of the world." Guess what -- he was wrong. One of his works was reincarnated as the Hardy-Weinberg law (named after Hardy and the German physician Wilhelm Weinberg [1862-1937]), a fundamental principle used by geneticists to study the evolution of populations. Put simply, the Hardy-Weinberg law states that if a large population is mating totally at random (and migration, mutation, and selection do not occur), then the genetic constitution remains constant from one generation to the next. Even Hardy's seemingly abstract work on <i>number theory</i> -- the study of the properties of the natural numbers -- found unexpected applications. In 1973, the British mathematician Clifford Cocks used the theory of numbers to create a breakthrough in cryptography -- the development of codes. Cocks's discovery made another statement by Hardy obsolete. In his famous book <i>A Mathematician's Apology,</i> published in 1940, Hardy pronounced: "No one has yet discovered any war-like purpose to be served by the theory of numbers." Clearly, Hardy was yet again in error. Codes have been absolutely essential for military communications. So even Hardy, one of the most vocal critics of applied mathematics, was "dragged" (probably kicking and screaming, if he had been alive) into producing useful mathematical theories. </p><p> But this is only the tip of the iceberg. Kepler and Newton discovered that the planets in our solar system follow orbits in the shape of ellipses -- the very curves studied by the Greek mathematician...</p></p><h2>Goldie Socks and the Three Libearians</h2><p>When Goldie Socks takes a shortcut through the woods when she is late for school, she comes across an intriguing cottage made of books.</p><p></p><h2>Night of the Moonjellies</h2><p>Seven-year-old Mark helps his grandmother and other family members run their seaside hot dog stand and then has a surprise at the end of the day.</p><p>Mark Shasha is a painter, writer and illustrator whose work has appeared in <i>The Boston Globe, The Phoenix, Boston Magazine</i> and other publications.

His use of light, shadows, and darkness in the luminous full-color double-page spreads invite readers right into the story.

Yet biographer Rodney Bolt admirably avoids the temptation to depict Da Ponte's life in stock operatic terms, delivering instead a nuanced account of an extraordinarily complicated man. He accomplishes this feat by firmly grounding Da Ponte in society: "He lived in four cities," Bolt writes, "Venice, Vienna, London and New York -- at fascinating moments in their histories. . . . Venice, in its splendid last throes, looked back on a thousand years of glory; Vienna was at a peak of eighteenth-century social experiment, and London the height of contemporary fashion; while New York surged into a post-Enlightenment, democratic, industrialized world." Skillfully depicting the librettist's life, Bolt insightfully reveals the poet's world.</p><p>Of the four cities in which Da Ponte resided, Vienna was the one that most facilitated his minor claim to immortality, for it was there that, in the employ of Emperor Joseph II, he wrote the librettos for three of Mozart's operas. Created in rapid succession between the years 1786 and 1790, all of them -- "The Marriage of Figaro," "Don Giovanni" and "Cos� Fan Tutte" -- became, in Bolt's words, "three of the most sublime operas ever composed." </p><p>Mozart was already famous as both a composer and a performer when he met Da Ponte, yet the librettist was arguably more prominent because he held the lofty title of poet to the Court Theater, while Mozart was in Vienna essentially as a freelancer. Titles mattered. Nevertheless, the rivalries and intrigues that flourished under Joseph's liberal rule prevented anyone from having lasting job security. Da Ponte's inexperience as both a librettist and a politician had already alienated the court composer, Antonio Salieri, who, following their first joint operatic failure, publicly vowed to chop off his fingers before working with the poet again. If Mozart needed Da Ponte to break into the potentially lucrative field of Italian opera, Da Ponte needed Mozart to preserve his tenuous position there. "Wolfgang Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte had much in common," Bolt astutely observes. "Both had a leg in the old world, yet were gingerly reaching with the other to find a foothold in a new territory that offered dignity and independence, but was perilous with pitfalls and threatened poverty and disaster." </p><p>Bolt attributes the triumph of their collaboration to similarities in personality -- a claim too vague to amount to more than idle speculation. He's far more convincing on how their common circumstances led to their joint productions. "The Marriage of Figaro" is especially interesting in this respect, since the play from which it was adapted had been effectively banned by Joseph for its satirical critique of aristocratic privilege. That ensured publicity for the opera but made it vulnerable to censorship -- and rendered its creators subject to censure. Why, then, did it succeed? Ever ambivalent toward the aristocracy that enabled yet constrained them, Mozart and Da Ponte interpreted the story of the put-upon servant Figaro in terms more sympathetic than satirical. And ever ambivalent toward the aristocracy that enabled yet constrained him, Joseph endorsed the opera when they presented it to him. "The Marriage of Figaro" was not only a result of Mozart and Da Ponte's ingenuity but also a creation of their era.</p><p>The circumstances of Da Ponte's life were likewise shaped by history. He did not move at once from court poet to neighborhood grocer. However, the death of Joseph less than a month after the opening of "Cos� Fan Tutte" and the ascension of his conservative brother swiftly put the librettist on the path to selling tomatoes and lettuce. Disagreements, tantrums and an ill-advised letter to the new ruler forced Da Ponte to run from Austria to England, where his fortunes didn't improve. Fleeing bankruptcy in London, he quickly found insolvency in the United States. Da Ponte's failures in the new world were not limited to the grocery business (which swiftly went under). He was a professor of Italian at Columbia who couldn't interest the student body in his native tongue. He was an impresario who couldn't sustain New York's first opera company. The combination of commercial ambition and cultural insecurity made young America largely inhospitable to a toothless old man and the courtly erudition he brought with him. His failings were, to an extent, those of the country.</p><p>Da Ponte died in New York in 1838. His life may have been as melodramatic as a grand opera, but it has taken Bolt's masterful biography to transform him, 168 years later, from stage character to historical figure. </p><p>Reviewed by Jonathon Keats <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

(<i>Vancouver Sun</i>) By the celebrated author of Canada Reads finalist <i>Indian Horse</i>, this is an unforgettable journey of a father and son, set in dramatic landscape of the BC Interior. For male and female readers equally, for readers of Joseph Boyden, Cormac McCarthy, Thomas King, Russell Banks and general literary fiction.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Franklin Starlight is called to visit his father, Eldon. He's sixteen years old and has had the most fleeting of relationships with the man. The rare moments they've shared haunt and trouble Frank, but he answers the call, a son's duty to a father. What ensues is a journey through the rugged and beautiful backcountry, and a journey into the past, as the two men push forward to Eldon's end. From a poverty-stricken childhood, to the Korean War, and later the derelict houses of mill towns, Eldon relates both the desolate moments of his life and a time of redemption and love, and in doing so offers Frank a history he has never known, the father he has never had, and a connection to himself he never expected. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A novel about love, friendship, courage, and the idea that the land has within it powers of healing, <i>Medicine Walk</i> reveals the ultimate goodness of its characters and offers a deeply moving and redemptive conclusion. Wagamese's writing soars and his insight and compassion are matched by his gift of communicating these to the reader.</p><p>RICHARD WAGAMESE is one of Canada's foremost writers and the author of twelve previous novels, including <i>Keeper'n Me</i> and <i>Indian Horse</i>, a recent Canada Reads Finalist.

All this is thanks to the gentle, insightful, user-friendly wisdom of my friend, Stephen Levine."&#x2014;Mark Victor Hansen, co-creator, #1 New York Times bestselling series, Chicken Soup for the Soul</p><p>"Feelings of loss don't go away; they go deeper," says grief counselor Stephen Levine, whose work over the past 30 years has won acclaim from the likes of [[LINK]][Elisabeth Ku[umlaut]bler-Ross]. He claims that chronic grief can result just as easily from the death of a loved one as it can from everyday disappointments like "unfulfilled ambitions." Whatever the source of one's sense of loss, Levine argues that grief must be thoroughly worked through, or it can lead insidiously to addiction, clinical depression, and other physical complaints. Borrowing heavily from Buddhist teachings, Levine recommends mindfulness meditation as one of several paths to reaching relief through "self-mercy." Unfortunately, as earnest he may be, Levine has a tendency to meanders in his writing, even in chapters that average just five pages in length. He's right that Americans in particular are too-often taught to "swallow our grief," but (likely distraught) readers may have a hard time wading through his ponderings to reach the far-between bits of concrete advice. --<i>Erica Jorgensen</i>STEPHEN LEVINE&#39;s many best-selling books include A Gradual Awakening and Who Dies?

The magic and mystique of the fall season are splendidly captured in Carolyn Roehm's <i>Fall Notebook: Garden, Hearth, Tradition, Home</i>, a collection of recipes, crafts, entertainment tips, and garden projects. In her introduction to the book, Roehm--former fashion designer turned author--writes, <blockquote>As a gardener, I feel a certain sadness as I am forced to break a bond that I have spent the spring and summer nurturing. Although it is easy for one to become nostalgic during this time, it is necessary to move forward because it is crucial to prepare for the long winter that lies ahead ... although those beautiful blooms are a long way off and we must put our garden to bed, we shift to a new buzz of life that is brought about by the gathering of family and friends under one roof for the holidays.</blockquote><p> Arranged by individual plants--dahlias and chrysanthemums can be counted on for their late-fall showiness--as well as specific projects and festivities, including Halloween, bulb planting, and Thanksgiving, each chapter offers a host of ideas for savoring autumn's flavor through arts and crafts projects, practical gardening tips, succulent recipes, and creative entertaining advice. Celebrate Turkey day in style with elegant place cards--easily created with a rubber stamp and ecru stationary--that compliment lemon leaf, eucalyptus berry, and autumn-hued rose table arrangements, while a menu of <i>poisson</i> with rosemary and sage, potato and parsnip pur�e, and pumpkin souffl�--all clearly spelled out in Roehm's meticulous recipes--would make any family thankful. With full-color photographs, pockets for storing ideas and graph paper for planning--not to mention useful lists to help you organize events and gardening chores--the <i>Fall Notebook</i> is as glorious to look at as it is practical to use.</p>Carolyne Roehm, noted author and lifestyle contributor to Good Morning America, brings her gardening expertise to viewers weekly as the host of Country Homes, Country Gardens.<p>In 1991, Roehm, who had always taken great pleasure in indulging and surrounding herself with things she loved, decided to turn her personal passion for beauty and comfort into a fulfilling career. A longtime associate (and neighbor) of famed couturier, Oscar de la Renta, Roehm began her own fashion business, setting her designs apart from many others in the industry with her unflagging insistence on only the finest quality materials. Her designs quickly found a home with discriminating consumers, as her first year alone saw revenues exceeding $3 million. But Roehm's passion for beauty extended beyond the world of fashion, and she became determined to broaden her horizons accordingly.</p><p>Following a stint at the famed Paris flower shop, Moulie Savart, Roehm took the knowledge she gained there and put it into practical use for the everyday gardener. Resulting from her considerable experience, she takes great joy in revealing the many secrets she learned to help everyone achieve a bountiful and beautiful garden.</p><p>In 1997, Roehm published her first book, A Passion for Flowers (September 1997, HarperCollins Publishers) in which she detailed the experts' tricks to perfect gardening. A firm believer in luxury for everyone, Roehm feels that luxury doesn't necessarily mean expensive. Her breathtaking floral arrangements, for example, traditionally contain many common flowers such as carnations, marigolds, bleeding hearts, and Queen Anne's lace, which she collects from her own garden at her Connecticut home.</p><p>Roehm applies the fashion lessons she learned to her flowers. The familiar cry of "accessorize" is as important to arranging blooms as it is to one's own appearance. "I can't tell you how often I've seen a dress ruined with the wrong accessories," Roehm explains. "It's the same with flowers. Even the most beautiful flowers don't work if they're in the wrong vase or placed against the wrong background."</p></p><h2>Halloween Night II (Point Horror Series)</h2><p>Unsettled by Dina&#39;s return to town and further upset by her boyfriend&#39;s escapades with another girl, Brenda hopes for a safer Halloween, unaware that someone has evil plans in store</p><p></p><h2>Hoosier Cabinets</h2><p>&#34;This book is for anyone who owns a &#34;Hoosier&#34; cabinet, is trying to find one, or is planning to restore one.

One of the great literary treasures of the Church. For this work and her letters, St. Catherine was named a Doctor of the Church. A classic. Impr. 344 pgs, PB</p><p>Saint Catherine of Siena's Dialogue describes the entire spiritual life through a series of conversations between God and the soul, represented by Catherine herself. Readers of The Dialogue will find Catherine's revelations from God as informative and formative as those who recognized her sanctity during her life. The universally applicable yet intimately personal messages she received from God are as much for us as they were for Catherine. We can read God's communications to his beloved daughter with detached awe or we can receive His messages to us through her writings. <p> Do you long for certainty that Divine Providence exists in the midst of our chaotic world? Does your prayer seem too dry, or too routine? Have you sought guidance for the challenges of your life from unhelpful people or things? Or has your pride kept you from humble obedience to the Church? If so, The Dialogue will provide consolation, encouragement, and hope.</p>Saint Catherine of Siena (March 25, 1347 - April 29, 1380) was a tertiary of the Dominican Order. She worked to bring the Papacy back to Rome from its displacement in France, and to establish peace among the Italian city-states. She was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1970 and is one of only three women Doctors of the Church. She is one of the two patron saints of Italy, together with Francis of Assisi. Catherine had her first vision of Christ when she was age five or six saying that Jesus smiled at her, blessed her, and left her in ecstasy. At age seven she vowed chastity. Her parents were not supportive of some of her religious desires. She was advised by her confessor and biographer Raymond of Capua to &#34;Build a cell inside your mind, from which you can never flee.&#34; Serving her family humbly became an opportunity for spiritual growth. A vision of St. Dominic strengthened her. Catherine received the habit of a Dominican tertiary. As a third order member she lived at home with her family. In about 1366, Catherine experienced what she described in her letters as a &#34;Mystical Marriage&#34; with Jesus. She was told by Christ to leave her withdrawn life and enter the public life of the world. Catherine dedicated much of her life to helping the ill and the poor. After investigation by the Dominican order, she began traveling with her followers advocating reform of the clergy and advising people that repentance and renewal could be done through &#34;the total love for God.&#34; She also began writing letters including to figures in authority as she begged for peace between the republics and principalities of Italy and for the return of the Papacy from Avignon, France to Rome. She corresponded with Pope Gregory XI, also asking him to reform the clergy and the administration of the Papal States. Through her requests and prayers, Pope Gregory XI returned his administration to Rome in January 1377. St Catherine&#39;s letters are considered one of the great works of early Tuscan literature. St Catherine died in Rome, the spring of 1380, at the age of thirty-three. Jesus Christ is also thought to have died at the same age. On May 5, 1940 Pope Pius XII named her a joint Patron Saint of Italy along with Saint Francis of Assisi. Pope Paul VI gave her the title of Doctor of the Church in 1970 along with Saint Teresa of Avila making them the first women to receive this honor. In 1999 Pope John Paul II made her one of Europe&#39;s patron saints.

He lives in Minneapolis.OCTOBER 3, 1918<br><br>He has already spent one night sleeping almost atop the bodies of dead men, French and German, dead for days and weeks and thankfully unseen now in the blackness, though there was no mistaking their odious, putrid smell. And so, when the whistles shrilly pierce the early-morning air, it is something of a relief to be up and off, although in the first rays of daylight, at least until he and his men are greeted rudely by the whistling of Minenwerfers and the zip-zip-zip of machine-gun bullets and, soon enough, the familiar, dull slapping sound of metal encountering flesh and bone, the accordant screams of the wounded, and the muffled coughing of those already dying.<br><br>Quickly out of the trench and up the hill, he pushes past blasted dugouts and through and over the wire, red with rust after four long years of war but still a prickly impediment to reaching the crest. Before too long he is almost to the top, almost there, through the wafting gray smoke and the squeezing pup-pup-pup of the machine guns and through the long brown grass and the shell holes pocking the hill like vacant black eyes and past the blue-green bodies of the dead, marine and German, and still he pushes on, almost laughing, almost floating from the sheer bloody wonder of it all; keep going, keep going, keep going. . . .<br><br>Artillery rounds plop at random here and there, sending black geysers of soil high into the air, and more men fall; keep going, keep going past deep redoubts and blasted, crumbling trench lines in which dead men lie splayed in their deathly innocence, and through the wafting acrid black smoke that stings the eyes; keep going.<br><br>Men scream; men die. He finds himself almost laughing. It is not so horrible to him, not so bad; he has done something like this before, at Belleau Wood and Soissons, and he knows it is something he will do yet again before this war is done.<br><br>His right hand oozes sweat, coursing slippery and wet down the handle of his .45, and more streams from his brow under his deeply dented helmet; a shadow at his side tumbles forward and lies still; keep going, keep going.<br><br>Almost at the top, he sees one of them racing away. He follows instinctively at a run and fires, almost laughing. Marines all along the line now reach the main trench and begin the work of the bayonet, or swing their rifles like baseball bats, or fall on the enemy with fists and knives, even, if that is what it takes.<br><br>A German officer suddenly appears from the dank recesses of a dugout. They eye each other, just for a split moment and pistol to pistol, as if they were gunslingers on the streets of old Laredo, each waiting for the other to draw. Suddenly, the German fires; he fires back. The German tumbles into his hole, a look of surprised horror on his face and a deep red stain spreading over his heart.<br><br>Keep going.<br><br>And as he does, he takes it all in, the chaos and the shouts and the shots and the smoke and the chattering guns and the wails of the wounded. He feels somehow impervious, almost immortal, as he moves now along the hilltop trench, tossing grenades and shooting until the brow of the massif is finally taken, and long lines of the enemy slouch down the hill even as ever more marines come up.<br><br>It is almost comical sometimes, he thinks; this war-making, these bloody, glorious, horrible, life-taking battles sometimes almost make him laugh.<br><br>God, he loves this war.<br><br>God, he loves this awful, tragic, soul-grinding, terrible, wasting, wonderful war.<br><br>LUCKY<br><br>Faster, goddamnit, faster!<br><br>Bleak figures bundled against the snow and leaning forward into the sleety wind, blanketed horses pulling the wagons of street vendors, gnarled immigrants wrapped in blankets and shoveling ice-clogged sidewalks, gaggles of truants heaving snowballs from tenement rooftops crisscrossed with a cat's cradle of wires; his taxi passed all of these things on the morning of January 22, 1918, speeding from Herald Square for the harbor, where the transport, the USS Henderson, either was, or was not, waiting at anchor.<br><br>And as the taxi raced on, twenty-four-year-old Clifton Bledsoe Cates fretted in the back, chain-smoking furiously and ignoring all of these varied sights of Lower Manhattan, his mind spinning gloomily as it obsessed on one overriding concern: that his career in the United States Marine Corps had died even as it was aborning, and he was finished.<br><br>His ship had been slated to leave port more than an hour beforehand, and he knew if he wasn't on board when it sailed, he'd be court-martialed for desertion.<br><br>"There is no question about it," he would recall with a comfortable laugh years later.<br><br>The old Henderson, carrying the 2nd Battalion of the 6th Regiment of marines, had sailed from Philadelphia on January 20. The next day it heaved to in New York Harbor, and the officers on board were allowed shore leave-with the understanding they would be back on board by eight a.m. So Cates headed to shore with his mates for the bright lights of the city. After some hours of carousing, he decided at two a.m. he'd had enough.<br><br>A heavy snow caressed the dark night in rippling currents, blanketing the streets, and there wasn't a taxi in sight. So he took a room at the grand McAlpin Hotel at Broadway and West Thirty-fourth Street instead, and left instructions with the night clerk to awaken him at six a.m.<br><br>He crawled into bed, not even bothering to take off his uniform.<br><br>When he awoke, it was well past nine a.m.<br><br>"I was frantic," he would recall.<br><br>He raced downstairs to the lobby and paused only long enough to colorfully tell the hapless clerk some of what he thought of him, and then hurried out of the hotel, quickly hailed a cab, and was soon speeding toward the docks, hoping against hope that the Henderson would be there, hoping against hope that this new life he was learning to love hadn't ended abruptly on the streets of New York on this cold and miserable morning, hoping that he could rejoin his men before they sailed into a world war and endure with them whatever was to come in the trenches that split France like a heaving sidewalk crack.<br><br>Faster, he told the hack. Faster . . .<br><br>Certainly more veterans would come out of World War I more famous than Clifton Bledsoe Cates, some of them becoming heroes for great exploits performed over the course of a minute, ten minutes, or a few hours. Some of their names would spill from the history pages in perpetuity: Alvin C. York, Cates's fellow Tennessean, was of course the most famous of these, and Sam Woodfill would have his measure of fame, as would Michael "Mad Dog" Ellis, wildcat marine John Joseph Kelly, Charles Whittlesey of "Lost Battalion" notoriety, and many others.<br><br>Clifton Bledsoe Cates was not destined to share as bright a spotlight. His acclaim, such as it was, came not for one single act-single-handedly capturing one hundred prisoners, bravely knocking out twelve machine guns with but a bayonet and a hand grenade-but for his body of work in World War I.<br><br>He would be knocked out, knocked down, gassed, nicked, pinged and dinged numerous times, and still rise to lead men; he would by force of example show men what they could do, what they needed to do; his bravery, his pluck, his sheer bursts of illuminating optimism would shine daily in the worst of circumstances during the second half of 1918, from Belleau Wood to Soissons to Blanc Mont and, finally, to the last days in the Meuse-Argonne; and it would be no coincidence that his unit-the 96th Company, 6th Marine Regiment-would suffer more casualties than any other American company in the Great War.<br><br>Cates did his work quietly, with almost unearthly confidence and a dash of derring-do; ordered forward over and over again, he would lead his company into the thickest of battles, and against all odds, and though his men fell dead and wounded all around him, he would emerge safe and alive and sometimes even laughing, as if protected by some divine providence.<br><br>Other marines could only shake their heads in wonder at him.<br><br>Cliff Cates, they all said. The luckiest man in the Great War.<br><br>He would become one of the most famous of United States marines, a Corps legend, and, on his way to becoming the nineteenth commandant of the Marine Corps in 1948, he would lead a platoon, then a company, then a regiment, and, finally, a division, into battle.<br><br>It was a somewhat unlikely destiny, perhaps, considering his origins were pastoral rather than martial to much degree. It had been expected that young Cliff Cates, born to some wealth at a long-held family cotton farm known as Cates Landing, Tennessee, at a spot where the broad Mississippi River dips south and then violently north again as it meanders toward the onetime earthquake epicenter at New Madrid, Missouri, would someday become a yeoman farmer and businessman like his father and grandfather, or an attorney, handling civil cases instead of ammunition boxes, under a shingle to be hung in Memphis, Knoxville, or maybe Nashville.<br><br>But as with some of the nation's other notable military commanders who came from the soil-Clarence Huebner comes to mind, as do Dwight Eisenhower and Ulysses S. Grant-Cates would find his calling as a lifer in the United States military. A world war that had not even been a shadow as Cliff gamboled among the fields and along the riverbanks of the Mississippi as a boy would provide the setting for a permanent career change, and provide as well the battlefields on which he would display the utter fearlessness and coolheadedness that would make him a Marine Corps legend.<br><br>Anderson Cates, his grandfather, had been born in North Carolina, but, like many restless souls of the time, meandered west, arriving in northwest Tennessee in 1836 with but two dollars to his name. He went to work as an overseer on a local plantation, and, by the late 1840s, had saved enough to purchase the riverfront acreage that would come to be known as Cates Landing.<br><br>There, the pioneer Anderson Cates finally put down roots, taking a wife, Alice Jane Emily Peacock, in August 1848; she soon died, and he remarried, this time to Susan Box, and together they farmed and produced nine children between 1851 and 1868.<br><br>A biography would note that while Mr. Cates was a Methodist, he was also "a Democrat"-among whose ranks were, as the historian James McPherson would put it, "yeoman farmers in the upcountry or backcountry who disliked city slickers, merchants, banks, Yankees, or anybody who might interfere with their freedom to live as they pleased."<br><br>Anderson Cates's fifth child, Willis Jones Cates, was born in 1860. He would spend his life improving on and prospering from his father's hard work, operating three cotton gins, farming the land, overseeing a general store at the landing, and also serving on the board of directors of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank in Tiptonville, ten miles south.<br><br>Willis took as his wife a local girl from a prominent family-Martha "Mattie" Darnall Bledsoe, whose maternal grandfather, Henry McKinney Darnall, at the age of thirty in 1838, had been made captain of the local militia. From then on he was known in accordance with peculiar Southern tradition as "the General," despite declining a commission with the Rebs, and despite being just one of only two men in Obion County to vote against Secession.<br><br>With one hand on the plow and another on a ledger, Willis was regarded as one of Lake County's most stolid citizens. "While not hasty in reaching a conclusion, his mind when once made up was unchangeable," his obituary in the local paper would read. "Modest and retiring of disposition and slow to put himself forward, nevertheless he possessed that force of character and strength of purpose that enabled him to face every situation squarely and to do 'justice though the heavens fall.'"<br><br>The first of two children born to Willis and Mattie Cates-a daughter, Katherine, would arrive in 1896-Clifton Bledsoe Cates was born at the family's riverbank home on August 31, 1893. As he grew, his cherubic face and soft features belied an inner strength developed through a childhood that rivaled that of Tom Sawyer, as his parents allowed young Cliff Cates plenty of room to roam, and plenty of time to explore the woods and the waters of the Mississippi, in which six-foot-long catfish still lolled at the bottom, and where the canebrakes and old-growth forests spreading east and south were still rife with targets.<br><br>Davy Crockett years before had hunted the same land, and on one single day, it was said, had killed twenty-five black bears within the borders of Obion County. Wild hogs, leftovers from Hernando de Soto's early explorations of the area, still posed a threat to a young boy, and water moccasins and the remaining bears and other fauna also taught any youngster wandering the woods to keep his wits about him at all times-or suffer the consequences.<br><br>Cliff Cates roved, he hunted, he trapped, he fished the river like a latter-day Huck Finn, and he learned how to work a shotgun-with dubious early results. On one occasion, he nearly blew his head off when he placed his weapon on a bottom fence post and it discharged upward, singeing his very eyebrows. On another, he endured a whipping at the hand of Willis Cates after shooting the prized family hog that he may have mistaken for the wild variety.<br><br>Attending first a country schoolhouse, he was bright but not particularly studious. His mind and body often roamed from his reading and recitations and mathematics to the lures of the nearby wilderness and Reelfoot Lake, a favorite of his uncles Council and Reuben. Though they farmed nearby, each year they spent a month drifting the lake's shallow waters, trapping and hunting and fishing. They also consorted with a rough-and-ready brand of outdoorsmen who were "a law unto themselves," as a newspaper story from 1893 would have it.<br><br>The lure of the wilderness and his testing of himself within it would remain constant themes in Cliff Cates's life. Combat, at heart, is a test of one's courage, will, and stamina-and the battlefield itself is a wilderness of dangers known and unseen, a place where heightened senses, learned responses, and sometimes plain old instinct could be the difference between life and death.<br><br>The wilderness and its tests imbued in the young Cliff Cates a lifelong self-confidence, and an independent streak that on a few occasions was rubbed raw against the strict discipline of the military. But his carefree ramblings, his life among the Indians, as it were, also imbued in him a certain cocksureness, while his family's modest wealth, and his parents' preaching, instilled in him a generosity of spirit and-perhaps oxymoronically for a Corps lifer-a compassion that would help him quickly endear himself to the men who followed him into hell on many a battlefield.</p><h2>Aunt Dimity and the Deep Blue Sea</h2><p>Sent with her twin five-year-old sons to a Scottish island after her high-profile attorney husband receives death threats, Lori Shepherd begins to suspect local foul play upon her discovery of a skull on the beach and the unlikely fortunes of several locals, a situation that prompts her to piece together clues with the assistance of Aunt Dimity. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>Nancy Atherton is the bestselling author of eighteen other Aunt Dimity mysteries.

Dead (Stone Barrington)</h2><p>In this action-packed thriller, Stone Barrington, an ex-cop turned lawyer, becomes caught between a woman abandoned on the altar and another suspected of murder. 150,000 first printing.</p><p>Stuart Woods is a master of the glitzy, high-concept, suspense thriller, and Stone Barrington, hero of five previous mysteries, is the kind of private cop who glides gracefully between lavishly detailed dinners, private jets, fancy parties, sexy assignations in luxury hotels, and the occasional murder investigation. Occasionally he gets his hands dirty, but more often it's his sheets. <i>L.A. Dead</i> finds him in Venice, where he's about to marry the beautiful (but seriously crazy) daughter of a high-ranking Mafioso, whose other daughter happens to be married to Stone's best friend--an NYPD cop, naturally. The civil ceremony's over, but the church wedding is only hours away when Stone is called to L.A., where his former lover has just discovered her husband's dead body. The lover is Arrington (an oddity, given Stone's surname; did Woods just run out of imagination here?), the dead husband is a famous movie star, and everyone believes she killed him. Everyone except Stone, who's still in love with Arrington. He has a helluva time interviewing (and bedding) all the women in her circle, including the dead husband's private secretary, Arrington's best friend, her lawyer's mistress, and a number of Hollywood wives. Jackie Collins does the ladies better, but Stone manages to save the damsel in distress, get rid of his nutty near-wife without offending her father, and wrap up all the details except the most important one. No doubt he's saving that for the next book. In the meantime, Woods's many fans will snap this up and spend the interim wondering: if Stone marries the woman of his dreams, will that make her Arrington Barrington? <i>--Jane Adams</i>Cop-turned-lawyer-and-investigator Stone Barrington ventures out to the West Coast -- and out on a limb -- in this scintillating tale of romance and murder from the bestselling author of The Run and Worst Fears Realized.<p>No Stone Unturned...</p><p>Trouble finds Stone smack in the middle of a romantic Mediterranean holiday.

With your thumbs, you excavate the cheese. You choose your stringbeans one at a time. You pulp the nectarines and rape the sweet corn. You are something wonderful, you are--people of the city--and we, who are almost without exception strangers here, are as absorbed with you as you seem to be with the numbers on our hanging scales. "Does every sink grow on your farm?" "Yes, ma'am." "It's marvellous. Absolutely every sink?" "Some things we get from neighbors up the road." "You don't have no avocados, do you?" "Avocados don't grow in New York State." "Butter beans?" "They're a Southern crop." "Who baked this bread?" "My mother. A dollar twenty-five for the cinnamon. Ninety-five cents for the rye." "I can't eat rye bread anymore. I like it very much, but it gives me a headache." Short, born abroad, and with dark hair and quick eyes, the woman who likes rye bread comes regularly to the Brooklyn Greenmarket, at Flatbush and Atlantic. I have seen her as well at the Fifty-ninth Street Greenmarket, in Manhattan. There is abundant evidence that she likes to eat. She must have endured some spectacular hangovers from all that rye. Farm goods are sold off trucks, vans, and pickups that come into town in the dark of the morning. The site shifts with the day of the week: Tuesdays, black Harlem; Wednesdays, Brooklyn; Fridays, Amsterdam at 102nd. There are two on Saturdays--the one at Fifty-ninth Street and Second Avenue, the other in Union Square. Certain farms are represented everywhere, others at just one or two of the markets, which have been primed by foundation funds and developed under the eye of the city. If they are something good for the urban milieu--tumbling horns of fresh plenty at the people's feet--they are an even better deal for the farmers, whose disappearance from the metropolitan borders may be slowed a bit by the many thousands of city people who flow through streets and vacant lots and crowd up six deep at the trucks to admire the peppers, fight over the corn, and gratefully fill our money aprons with fresh green city lettuce. "How much are the tomatoes?" "Three pounds for a dollar." "Peaches?" "Three pounds for a dollar twenty-five." "Are they freestones?" "No charge for the pits." "How much are the tomatoes?" "Three pounds for a dollar. It says so there on the sign." "Venver the eggs laid?" "Yesterday." "Kon you eat dum raw?" We look up from the cartons, the cashbox, the scales, to see who will eat the eggs raw. She is a good-looking big-framed young blonde. "You bet. You can eat them raw." "How much are the apples?" "Three pounds for a dollar." Three pounds, as we weigh them out, are anywhere from forty-eight to fifty-two ounces. Rich Hodgson says not to charge for an extra quarter pound. He is from Hodgson Farms, of Newburgh, New York, and I (who come from western New Jersey) have been working for him off and on for three months, summer and fall. I thought at first that I would last only a week, but there is a mesmerism in the selling, in the coins and the bills, the all-day touching of hands. I am often in charge of the peppers, and, like everyone else behind the tables by our truck, I can look at a plastic sack of them now and tell its weight. "How much these weigh? Have I got three pounds?" "That's maybe two and a quarter pounds you've got there." "Weigh them, please." "There it is. Two and a quarter pounds." " <i>Very</i> good." "Fantastic! Fantastic! You see that? You see that? He knew exactly how much it weighed." I scuff a boot, take a break for a shiver in the bones. There are unsuspected heights in this game, moments that go right off the scale. This is the Brooklyn market, in appearance the most cornucopian of all. The trucks are drawn up in a close but ample square and spill into its center the colors of the country. Greengage plums. Ruby Red onions. Yellow crookneck squash. Sweet white Spanish onions. Starking Delicious plums. Fall pippins ("Green as grass and curl your teeth"). McIntoshes, Cortlands, Paulareds. ("Paulareds are new and are lovely apples. I'll bet they'll be in the stores in the next few years.") Pinkish-yellow Gravensteins. Gold Star cantaloupes. Patty Pan squash. Burpless cucumbers. Cranberry beans. Silver Queen corn. Sweet Sue bicolor corn, with its concise tight kernels, its well-filled tips and butts. Boston salad lettuce. Parris Island romaine lettuce. Ithaca iceberg crunchy pale lettuce. Orange tomatoes. Cherry Bell tomatoes. Moreton Hybrid, Jet Star, Setmore, Supersonic, Roma, Saladette tomatoes. Campbell 38s. Campbell 1327s. Big Boy, Big Girl, Redpak, Ramapo, Rutgers London-broil thick-slice tomatoes. Clean-shouldered, supple-globed Fantastic tomatoes. Celery (Imperial 44). Hot Portugal peppers. Four-lobed Lady Bell glossy green peppers. Aconcagua frying peppers. Parsley, carrots, collard greens. Stuttgarter onions, mustard greens. Dandelions. The people, in their throngs, are the most varied we see--orthat anyone is likely to see in one place west of Suez. This intersection is the hub if not the heart of Brooklyn, where numerous streets converge, and where Fourth Avenue comes plowing into the Flatbush-Atlantic plane. It is also a nexus of the race. "Weigh these, please." "Will you please weigh these?" Greeks. Italians. Russians. Finns. Haitians. Puerto Ricans. Nubians. Muslim women in veils of shocking pink. Sunnis in total black. Women in hiking shorts, with babies in their backpacks. Young Connecticut-looking pants-suit women. Their hair hangs long and as soft as cornsilk. There are country Jamaicans, in loose dresses, bandannas tight around their heads. "Fifty cents? Yes, dahling. Come on a sweetheart, mon." There are Jews by the minyan, Jews of all persuasions --white-bearded, black-bearded, split-bearded Jews. Down off Park Slope and Cobble Hill come the neo-bohemians, out of the money and into the arts. "Will you weigh this tomato, please?" And meantime let us discuss theatre, books, environmental impacts. Maybe half the crowd are men--men in cool Haspel cords and regimental ties, men in lipstick, men with blue eyelids. Corporate-echelon pinstripe men. Their silvered hair is perfect in coif; it appears to have been audited. Easy-going old neighborhood men with their shirts hanging open in the summer heat are walking galleries of abdominal and thoracic scars--Brooklyn Jewish Hospital's bastings and tackings. (They do good work there.) A huge clock is on a tower high above us, and as dusk comes down in the autumn months the hands glow Chinese red. The stations of the hours light up like stars. The clock is on the Williamsburgh Savings Bank building, a skyscraper full of dentists. They go down at five into the Long Island Rail Road, under us. Below us, too, are all the subways of the city, in ganglion assembled. "How much are the cabbages?" "Forty cents a head." "O.K. Weigh one, please." We look around at empty storefronts, at J. Rabinowitz &amp; Sons' SECURITY FIREPROOF STORAGE, at three gold balls (Gem Jewelers Sales), at Martin Orlofsky's Midtown Florist Nursery. Orlofsky has successfully objected to our presence as competitors here, and we can sell neither plants nor flowers. "HAVE YOU HAD ANY LATELY? CLAMS, STEAMERS." Across Fourth Avenue from the Greenmarket is the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer, a century and a quarter old, with what seem to be, even in the brightest morning light, black saints in its stained-glass windows. Far down Fourth, as if at rest on the paved horizon, stands a tower of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. To the northwest rises the Empire State. Not long after dawn, as trucks arrive and farmers begin to open boxes and set up wooden tables, a miscellany of whores is calling it a day--a gradual dispersal, quitting time. Their corner is Pacific and Fourth. Now and again, a big red Cadillac pauses at the curb beside them. The car's rear window is shaped like a heart. With some frequency, a squad car will slide up to the same curb--a week-in, week-out, endless duet with the Cadillac. The women hurry away. "Here come the law." The Greenmarket space, which lies between Atlantic and Pacific, was once occupied by condemned buildings--spent bars and liquor stores. The block is fenced and gravelled now, and is leased by the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which charges the Greenmarket seventy-five dollars a Wednesday. The market does not fill the lot--the rest is concession parking. Here in the din of the city, in the rivers of moving metal, some customers drive to the Greenmarket as if it were a roadside stand in Rockland County, a mall in Valley Stream. On a sidewalk around the corner, people with a Coleman stove under a fifty-five-gallon drum are making sauce with our tomatoes. Tall black man in a business suit now picks up a slim hot pepper. Apparently he thinks it sweet, because he takes most of it with a single bite and chews it with anticipant relish. Three ... two ... one. The small red grenade explodes on his tongue. His eyeballs seem to smoke. By the fistful, he grabs cool stringbeans and stuffs them into his mouth. I forget to give change to a middle-aged woman with bitter eyes. I charged her forty-five cents for a pound and a third of apples and she gave me half a dollar. Now she is demanding her nickel, and her eyes are narrower than the sides of dimes. She is a round-shouldered person, beaky and short--shortchanged. In her stare at me, there is an entire judiciary syste...</p><h2>SIGNED! This Book Loves You (Paperback)</h2><p>SIGNED!

Twenty years ago, the Ashertons' young son, Matthew, a musical prodigy, drowned in a swollen stream while in the company of his sister Julia -- Connor Swann's wife.</p><p>Police Superintendant Duncan Kincaid and Sergeant Gemma James quickly discover that Connor's death was no accident, and that nothing in the Asherton family is as it seems. Connor, though estranged from Julia for more than a year, still lives in her London apartment, where his exploits with women and gambling suggest plenty of motives. The Ashertons are far more attached to Connor than to their own daughter, and these are only the first of the secrets that haunt the suspects. New lies cover older lies, as Kincaid finds himself dangerously drawn to Julia Swann, and Gemma must confront her own troubling feelings for Kincaid.</p></p><p><p>Deborah Crombie is a native Texan who has lived in both England and Scotland. She lives in McKinney, Texas, sharing a house that is more than one hundred years old with her husband, two cats, and two German shepherds.</p>In the third in Crombie's Duncan Kincaid/Gemma James series, the Scotland Yard detectives are called in to investigate when a body is found floating in a Thames River lock. Before long, the two find themselves untangling a complicated web of family lies and deception. Thanks to narrator Michael Deehy's layered performance, listeners feel Kincaid and James's attraction to one another yet understand their reluctance to complicate their working lives by allowing it to surface. Deehy's secondary characters are multidimensional and intriguing, especially when Kincaid finds himself inexplicably drawn to the victim's estranged wife. Crombie's insightful writing and an engrossing reading by Deehy make this haunting whodunit well worth hearing.

Mary Wollstonecraft and Mary Shelley have each been the subject of numerous biographies, yet no one has ever examined their lives in one book&#x2014;until now. In <i>Romantic Outlaws, </i>Charlotte Gordon reunites the trailblazing author who wrote <i>A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</i> and the Romantic visionary who gave the world <i>Frankenstein</i>&#x2014;two courageous women who should have shared their lives, but instead shared a powerful literary and feminist legacy.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1797, less than two weeks after giving birth to her second daughter, Mary Wollstonecraft died, and a remarkable life spent pushing against the boundaries of society&#x2019;s expectations for women came to an end. But another was just beginning. Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s daughter Mary was to follow a similarly audacious path. Both women had passionate relationships with several men, bore children out of wedlock, and chose to live in exile outside their native country. Each in her own time fought against the injustices women faced and wrote books that changed literary history.<br> &nbsp;<br> The private lives of both Marys were nothing less than the stuff of great Romantic drama, providing fabulous material for Charlotte Gordon, an accomplished historian and a gifted storyteller. Taking readers on a vivid journey across revolutionary France and Victorian England, she seamlessly interweaves the lives of her two protagonists in alternating chapters, creating a book that reads like a richly textured historical novel. Gordon also paints unforgettable portraits of the men in their lives, including the mercurial genius Percy Shelley, the unbridled libertine Lord Byron, and the brilliant radical William Godwin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Brave, passionate, and visionary, they broke almost every rule there was to break,&#x201d; Gordon writes of Wollstonecraft and Shelley.

They were on their way to visit her mother&#x2019;s grave in a cemetery as familiar to Mary as her own home. She and her father, William, came here almost every day. The churchyard was more like a pasture than a burial ground. The grass grew in uneven clumps; old gravestones lay toppled on the ground, and a low rail separated the grounds from the open countryside.<br> &nbsp;<br> William Godwin did not think it was odd to teach his small daughter to read from her mother&#x2019;s tombstone. And Mary was eager to learn anything her father had to teach. In her eyes, he was &#x201c;greater, and wiser, and better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. than any other being.&#x201d; He was also all she had left.<br> &nbsp;<br> She began by tracing each letter with her fingers: &#x201c;Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin.&#x201d; Except for the &#x201c;Wollstonecraft,&#x201d; this name was the same as hers: MARY GODWIN. One dead. One alive. This gravestone could be her own. She yearned to be reunited with her mother, Mary Wollstonecraft, the woman she had never known, but whom she loved all the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mary Godwin had been born on August&nbsp;30, 1797, at the end of a month when a comet had burned through the London skies. People all over England had speculated about its meaning. A happy omen, her parents had thought. They could not know that Wollstonecraft would die of childbed fever ten days later, leaving behind a daughter so small and weak it seemed likely she would soon join her mother. But under the care of Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s dear friend Maria Reveley, Mary gradually grew stronger, and by the time she was a month old, though still undersized, she howled at all hours of the day and night. Her sweet-�tempered half sister, three-�year-�old Fanny, Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s illegitimate child by another man, tried to calm her tears, but there was nothing anyone could do. Mary would not be soothed.<br> &nbsp;<br> Godwin asked his friend William Nicholson, an expert in physiognomy, to measure Mary&#x2019;s cranium and facial features, but the baby shrieked through the entire examination, leading an exasperated Nicholson to report, &#x201c;The mouth was too much employed to be well observed.&#x201d; However, he told Godwin he saw evidence of &#x201c;considerable memory and intelligence&#x201d; as well as a &#x201c;quick sensibility.&#x201d; The only potential negative, Nicholson said, noting her screams, was that she could be &#x201c;petulant in resistance.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Godwin, Fanny, and Mary lived at No. 29 the Polygon, a semicircular block of tall Georgian homes in Somers Town, about two miles north of St. Paul&#x2019;s.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Polygon has long since been torn down, and though a plaque on Werrington Street says that the Godwins once lived here, it is an act of the imagination to picture them behind St. Pancras today. Hospitals, new developments, and council estates have replaced the shops, rose gardens, and cow sheds of Mary&#x2019;s childhood. In the early 1800s, her home was deep in the country. A dirt path led through a white turnstile into Clarendon Square, where thirty-�two terraced buildings had been constructed as an early experiment in suburban living. No. 29 had a large parlor with a marble mantelpiece where Godwin received guests and where Mary and Fanny learned to be quiet during grown-�up conversations. The family ate their suppers upstairs in the dining room and could stand outside on a wrought iron balcony to gaze out over the wild heaths, Hampstead and Highgate. From her bedroom window on the top floor, Mary could see the River Fleet and the narrow lane that led to her mother&#x2019;s grave.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spacious and elegant, these homes were affordable because they were far from the fashionable West End, but for the Godwins and many like them, Somers Town was the ideal compromise, a modern realtor&#x2019;s truism: the tranquillity of a small town within walking distance of the city, an &#x201c;outleap&#x201d; of London, as one contemporary called such developments. When Mary was old enough, she and Fanny toured the square with their nurse, gazing in the plate glass windows of the apothecary, the toymaker, the mercer, the haberdasher, the saddler, and the milliner. Sometimes, they were allowed to pick out a ribbon, or drink a frothy syllabub, a delicious whipped cream confection, at the tea shop. A muffin seller whose nickname was the Mayor of Garratt circled the square, pushing his cart and ringing a handbell. Watchmakers and goldsmiths hunched over worktables, hammering precious metals or examining pocket watches with a magnifying glass. These men were refugees from the French Revolution, and if the girls were lucky, one might look up and salute them with a little bow, or say bonjour through the open door, an exotic experience.<br> &nbsp;<br> Godwin adhered to a routine that to his daughters seemed carved in stone, as unwavering as the steady tick of the clock. A renowned political philosopher and novelist, Godwin did not allow any interruptions when he was writing; ideas came first in the Godwin household. He worked until one, lunched, and then read to the girls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Together they enjoyed Perrault&#x2019;s Mother Goose and La Fontaine&#x2019;s Fables. On special days, Godwin chose the book their mother had written for Fanny before she died. Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s warm, chatty style made it seem as though she were actually in the room: &#x201c;When you were hungry, you began to cry,&#x201d; she said, addressing Fanny directly. &#x201c;You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It was not long before another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reminders of this loving mother were everywhere, from the portrait that hung in Godwin&#x2019;s study to the books that lined the shelves. Godwin did his best to honor his dead wife, but he was not well suited for the education of small children. He had been a bachelor for most of his life, marrying Mary Wollstonecraft when he was forty-�one. Raised by stern Calvinists, he could be excruciatingly reserved and was stingy with both time and money, carefully parceling out his hours to avoid losing any work time.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the late afternoons, distinguished men and women flocked to pay him tribute. Many of Godwin&#x2019;s visitors were eager to meet Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s children, particularly Mary, who, as the daughter of two such intellectual heavyweights, seemed destined for fame. She had grown used to hearing a hush when she entered the room, an intake of breath, as though she were a great dignitary; they pointed to her fine reddish hair, her large light eyes&#x2014;�how like her mother, they said&#x2014;�how wonderful the first Mary had been, how wise and brave, how loving; a genius and a beautiful woman, too. Surely, her daughter would follow in her footsteps.<br> &nbsp;<br> Brown-�haired and scarred by a bout with chicken pox, Fanny receded into the background during these events. She knew that she came second to Mary. When Godwin married Wollstonecraft, he had adopted Fanny, who was the daughter of Gilbert Imlay, Wollstonecraft&#x2019;s previous lover. Godwin loved Fanny, but he adored his &#x201c;own&#x201d; daughter, describing Mary as &#x201c;quick,&#x201d; &#x201c;pretty,&#x201d; and &#x201c;considerably superior&#x201d; to Fanny, who was &#x201c;slow&#x201d; and &#x201c;prone to indolence.&#x201d; If anyone had pointed this out to him&#x2014;�his obvious favoritism&#x2014;�he would have said he was simply stating the truth; all evidence pointed to little Mary&#x2019;s superiority, an observation that had the added benefit of demonstrating his own superiority over Imlay. To his credit, Godwin had never judged Wollstonecraft for her affair, but he was not above being jealous of the passion she had felt for Imlay.<br> &nbsp;<br> Godwin&#x2019;s infatuation notwithstanding, young Mary did strike others as an unusual child. Delicate, with pale, almost unearthly skin, coppery curls, enormous eyes, and a tiny mouth, she had entered the world in such a tragic fashion that sorrow trailed behind her like the train of a wedding dress. When visitors talked to her, they were impressed by what seemed to be her preternatural intelligence. George Taylor, one of Godwin&#x2019;s fans, called on the widower twice during the first year of Mary&#x2019;s life. On the first visit, although he enjoyed playing with baby Mary, he did not notice anything out of the ordinary. It was on his second visit that he was startled when it seemed the nine-�month-�old &#x201c;knew me instantly and stretched out her arms.&#x201d; How could she have remembered him?<br> &nbsp;<br> One of Mary&#x2019;s particular devotees was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who first visited the Polygon in the winter of 1799 when he was twenty-�seven years old and Mary was two. An admirer of Godwin, but even more so of Wollstonecraft, the young poet was lonely, estranged from his wife and living apart from his own family. When he came to dinner, he stayed long past the girls&#x2019; bedtime, keeping the Godwins up late with his stories.<br> &nbsp;<br> To the girls, he was like a magical creature from Mother Goose. With a dimpled chin, a pudgy face, long messy hair, bushy eyebrows, and astonishingly red lips, Coleridge was a spellbinding storyteller. Even the pedantic Godwin was content to sit and listen to him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Coleridge, though, was startled by the stillness of his audience. Godwin had trained his daughters to be perfectly behaved in company&#x2014;�too well behaved, Coleridge thought. Even Mary, who was far more free-�spirited than her sister, could be silent for hours in the presence of guests, hardly even fidgeting. Later, Mary would say that though her father loved her, he was a stern taskmaster and rarely affectionate. In one of her fictional portraits of a father and daughter based on her own relationship with Godwin, she wrote:<br> [My father] never caressed me; if ever he stroked my head or drew me on his knee, I felt a mingled alarm and delight difficult to describe. Yet, strange to say, my father loved me almost to idolatry; and I knew this and repaid his affection with enthusiastic fondness, notwithstanding his reserve and my awe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Godwin&#x2019;s coldness was harming his daughters, Coleridge thought. Fanny and Mary should be more like his own little boy, three-�year-�old Hartley, who was rarely quiet and never still. He rode the wind like a bird, Coleridge said, &#x201c;using the air of the breezes as skipping-�ropes.&#x201d; Initially, Godwin was impressed by the proud father&#x2019;s description of this young free spirit, but he changed his mind when he actually met Hartley, who, as Coleridge remembered it, &#x201c;gave the philosopher such a rap on the shins with a ninepin that Gobwin [as Hartley called him] in huge pain lectured [Coleridge&#x2019;s wife] on his boisterousness.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> However, Godwin had enough respect for the poet to allow his friend to try to enliven his daughters. Although Coleridge was the author of somber poems such as Dejection: An Ode and The Ancient Mariner, he liked jokes of all kinds and had a vast repertoire of tricks. He loved ghost stories and knew quantities of nursery rhymes. &#x201c;I pun, conundrumize, listen and dance,&#x201d; he once said to a friend. He made his fingers gallop like horses or &#x201c;fly like stags pursued by the staghounds&#x201d;&#x2014;�a trick he immortalized in a letter to Wordsworth in which he tells his fellow poet how to make his hands do &#x201c;the hop, trot and gallop&#x201d; of hexameter lines.<br> &nbsp;<br> Few could resist Coleridge&#x2019;s charm, and Fanny and Mary were no exception. The poet was a thrilling departure from anyone they had ever met. When he sat in their front parlor, anything might happen: a witch might tumble down the chimney; a specter might float by. When he spilled wine on the carpet, instead of frowning as he did when the girls made such mistakes, Godwin actually laughed. Although some physical ailment always troubled the poet&#x2014;�his head ached, his throat was sore, his eye was infected, his stomach churned&#x2014;�these ailments did not stop him from devoting himself to the Godwin girls.<br> &nbsp;<br> Tapping into his enormous capacity to be fascinated, Coleridge bestowed on the girls&#x2014;�even Mary, who could barely remember her first visit with the great poet&#x2014;�the feeling that they were delightful and their ideas worth listening to. He called them forward, and although Fanny resisted, Mary loved the sensation of coming out from behind a curtain, of being pushed onstage in a house where her father ruled supreme. For her, and all the Godwins, it was a sad day when Coleridge left to rejoin his family in the Lake Country in 1802. But within a few weeks, Mary and Fanny settled back into the comforts of the nursery and their quiet routine, and it was only Godwin who continued to suffer. Restless and lonely, he wanted to remarry, to find a wife to share his life, his bed, and the burden of raising children. Coleridge had made it clear to him that his daughters needed more than he could provide. They needed a mother&#x2019;s touch.</p><h2>The Disappearance of the Universe: Straight Talk About Illusions, Past Lives, Religion, Sex, Politics, and the Miracles of Forgiveness</h2><p>What would you do if you were sitting quietly in your living room when two mysterious strangers appeared from out of nowhere &#x2014; and then told you they were "ascended masters" who had come to reveal some shocking secrets of existence and teach you the miraculous powers of forgiveness? Would you call the cops? Call a psychiatrist? Call out for pizza? <p>When two such teachers appeared before Gary Renard in 1992, he chose to listen to them (and ask a lot of impertinent questions). The result is this startling book: an extraordinary record of 17 mind-bending conversations that took place over nearly a decade, reorienting the author&#x2019;s life and giving the world an uncompromising perspective on <i>A Course in Miracles</i> &#x2014; a spiritual teaching destined to change human history. </p><p><i>"During our exchanges you will find out what you really are, how you got here, exactly why you and all other people behave and feel the way that you do, why the universe keeps repeating the same patterns over and over again, why people get sick, the reason behind all failure, accidents, addictions and natural disasters, the real cause of all of the violence, crime, war and terrorism in the world, the only meaningful solution to all of these things and how to apply it. . .You will not find compromise with us, and you will not always like it. That doesn&#x2019;t matter. If we gave you everything you think you want, you&#x2019;d be looking for something else a month later. With God&#x2019;s speed we followed our way home. Our intention now is to help you find yours."</i></p></p><p>NAMED A 2003 &#34;BOOK OF THE YEAR&#34; FINALIST BY FOREWORD MAGAZINEWhile living in a rural area of Maine I was witness to a series of in-the-flesh appearances by two ascended masters named Pursah and Arten, who eventually identified their previous incarnations as including those of Saint Thomas and Saint Thaddaeus. (Despite popular myth, those lifetimes as two of the original disciples were not their final ones.) My visitors did not come forth in order to repeat some of the spiritual platitudes that many people already believe. Rather, they revealed no less than the secrets of the universe, discussed the true purpose of life, and spoke in detail about The Gospel of Thomas. They also clarified the principles of an astounding spiritual document that will usher in a new way of thinking that will become more prevalent in the new millennium. <p>You don&#x2019;t have to believe these appearances took place in order to derive benefits from the information in this book. However, I can vouch for the extreme unlikeliness of this book being written by an uneducated layman such as myself without inspiration by these masters. At any rate, I leave it up to readers to think whatever they choose about the book&#x2019;s origins. </p><p>I personally believe that The Disappearance of the Universe can be helpful, time-saving reading for any open-minded person who is on a spiritual path. After you experience this message, it may be impossible for you &#x2014; as it was for me &#x2014; ever to look at your life or think of the universe the same way again.</p></p><h2>Kaffe Fassett&#39;s Kaleidoscope of Quilts: Twenty Designs from Rowan for Patchwork and Quilt</h2><p><p><br>In <strong>Kaffe Fassett's Kaleidoscope of Quilts</strong>, you'll discover 20 individual designs that feature both the new fabrics in Rowan's patchwork range and some firm favorites.

She has been singing ever since: on local radio; with Tony Pastor's orchestra; in big-box-office Hollywood films; at the Hollywood Bowl, the London Palladium, and Carnegie Hall; on her own television series; and at venues large and small across the country and around the world. The list of Rosemary Clooney's friends and intimates reads like a who's who of show business royalty: Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Marlene Dietrich, Tony Bennett, Janet Leigh, Humphrey Bogart, and Billie Holiday, to name just a few. She's known enormous professional triumphs and deep personal tragedies.<br><br>At the age of twenty-five, Rosemary Clooney married the erudite and respected actor Jos� Ferrer, sixteen years her senior and light-years more sophisticated. Trouble started almost immediately when, on her honeymoon, she discovered that he had already been unfaithful. Finally, after having five children while she almost single-handedly supported the entire family and endured Ferrer's numerous, unrepentant infidelities, she filed for divorce. From there her life spiraled downward into depression, addiction to various prescription drugs, and then, in 1968, a breakdown and hospitalization.<br><br>After years spent fighting her way back to the top, Rosemary Clooney is now married to one of her first and long-lost loves--a true fairy tale with a happy ending. She's been nominated for four Grammys in six years and has had two albums at the top of the Billboard charts. In the words of one of Stephen Sondheim's Follies showgirls, she could well be singing, triumphantly, "I'm still here!"</p><p><i>Girl Singer</i> is that rarity, an entertainer's autobiography that sidesteps the usual cash-in maneuvers, instead earning the label of memoir. Rosemary Clooney, of course, is the 1950s pop sweetheart ("Come On-a My House," a song she detested) turned 1960s nervous-breakdown casualty and, finally, comeback kid with a well-loved interpretive style. She recalls a hectic childhood spent mostly under the wing of her grandmother, who was better equipped than her parents to raise Rosemary, sister Betty, and brother Nick. The memories are often seen through a filter of tough poetry, as in this vivid passage:<p> "One very cold winter day, when I was five and Betty just about two, we got dressed up in one of our aunts' long dresses. 'Now we have to go down to the river,' I told Betty, 'because we're going on a long trip, and we have to wait by the river till the boat comes.' </p><p> "Betty skidded down the slick grading into the river. The dark water closed above her head.</p><p> "I leaned over, grabbed her hand, and dragged her out. She wasn't crying, just coughing and sputtering. I got her home and into the bathtub and then dried off, all by myself--my mother had told me I would manage, I would be able to do whatever had to be done."</p><p> Near the height of her fame, Clooney herself became the mother of five, as well as the long-suffering wife of actor Jos� Ferrer, who cheated on her early and often. Another romance, with arranger Nelson Riddle, was both her happiest and most turbulent; she remembers Riddle divorcing his first wife and then abruptly marrying his secretary. By 1968, Clooney was suffering prescription drug-induced delusions, imagining a month after his assassination that her friend Bobby Kennedy was still alive and ready to deliver a "lesson for me... to teach the American people." After several false starts, she broke her addiction and made a comeback that's seen her garner several Grammy nominations (and laugh about losing each time to pal Tony Bennett). Hard-won peace may be a clich�, but <i>Girl Singer</i> demonstrates it as the 71-year-old girl singer's truth. <i>--Rickey Wright</i></p>Early Praise for <b>Girl Singer</b>:<br><br>"Hearing Rosemary Clooney sing is like a taste of honey; reading her book is a full and delicious meal."<br>--Stanley Donen<br><br>"A beautiful book.

At times, this book will break your heart, but throughout, it will open your heart."<br>--Gavin de Becker, author of <b>The Gift of Fear</b><br><br>"Not only is Rosemary Clooney 'Girl Singer'--she is 'Girl Everywoman.' In other words, she is one hell of a person--and the book tells us all why."<br>--Janet Leigh<br><br>"Just as Rosemary's voice has a unique, unforgettable quality all its own, so does her autobiography. In my book, she stands alone. A true American treasure."<br>--Ann Rutherford<br><br>"Rosemary Clooney's eyes are illuminated by intelligence and mischief. Like her music, she is without guile or self-promotion. Amidst the hubbub of her stories, there are hints of longing, of missing people who nourished her in special intimate ways. These vanished citizens are the motors of the songs. In her autobiography, they are revealed and revered. And of course there's the mischief and the music."<br>--Jonathan Schwartz<br><br>"This book is a must for all who have loved the talent of Rosemary Clooney over the years as I have.

Go get your musket.&#x201d;</p><p>Will Pike stood his ground instead. He studied the woods. He glanced up at a hawk making perfect circles in a perfect blue sky.</p><p>And for a moment, he was a boy again, daydreaming that he could see what the hawk saw: the mountains of New Hampshire and Vermont to the north; the flatlands of Connecticut and Rhode Island spreading south; the steeples of Boston, tiny on the eastern horizon; and beyond them, the sharp-etched green islands in the Gulf of Maine.</p><p>Then the hawk seemed to stop in midair. Then it swooped, pouncing in a burst of feathers and fur on some hapless field mouse working its way home.</p><p>Will wiped his palms on his leather jerkin. He was as rawboned as any seventeen-year-old, but his eyes were already set in the permanent squint of one who studied the world quietly, who thought hard before he spoke and even harder before he acted.</p><p>His brother, North, was six years older and, it seemed, twice as big, over six feet tall, over two hundred pounds, big face scarred from fights, big hands scarred from fishhooks, big shoulders callused from the harness he wore when he plowed his father&#x2019;s fields.</p><p>North had marched with Washington&#x2019;s army. He had fished on the Grand Banks. He had cut trees in the great woods. Will had not seen much more of the world than the circle of earth beneath the circle of sky drawn by that hawk.</p><p>They stood that morning on the sloping ground in front of their father&#x2019;s little house. Rock walls ran everywhere, segmenting the small farm into smaller fields, each of which looked as if it had been sown with rocks in the hope of growing more rocks.</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;d Pa go?&#x201d; North kept his eyes on the men riding up the road.</p><p>&#x201c;Inside,&#x201d; said Will.</p><p>&#x201c;Went to get his musket, I hope.&#x201d;</p><p>Will glanced toward the house. He could not believe that his father was leaving them to face this alone.</p><p>The sheriff reined his horse and looked down at North. &#x201c;Well ... the prodigal brother. When did you get back?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When I heard you was plannin&#x2019; to arrest my Pa.&#x201d; North held his musket at his hip. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m loaded with ball and buck, Chauncey. I&#x2019;ll take down the lot of you with one shot.&#x201d;</p><p>Will wanted to slip into the house and coax his father out, but he feared that if he moved, North would start shooting. So he stayed put and hoped that no one would see his knees shaking.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, boys ...&#x201d; Sheriff Chauncey Yates had a big belly and a broad face better suited to grins and good spirits than the scowl he wore. &#x201c;The court says your father&#x2019;s to spend six months in the Hampshire County House of Correction for nonpayment of debts to Mr. Nathan Liggett of Springfield.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn the courts,&#x201d; said North. &#x201c;And damn Nathan Liggett. Damn you, too, Sheriff. And while we&#x2019;re doin&#x2019; our damnin&#x2019;, damn the damn state for taxin&#x2019; us at thirty damn percent, so we don&#x2019;t have the money to pay any other damn bills.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s happenin&#x2019; to farmers all over,&#x201d; said the sheriff. &#x201c;The state has to tax property to pay war debts. And farmers has more <i>real</i> property than most.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But farmers don&#x2019;t have hard coin,&#x201d; said Will, &#x201c;and the state won&#x2019;t take barter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nor merchants neither,&#x201d; added North.</p><p>&#x201c;Because merchants is squeezed by Boston creditors,&#x201d; said the sheriff, &#x201c;and <i>they&#x2019;re</i> squeezed by European suppliers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So men like our Pa get squeezed by lawyers,&#x201d; said North.</p><p>&#x201c;Yup.&#x201d; The sheriff swung a leg and dismounted. &#x201c;Makes you wonder why we fought the damn Revolution in the first place.&#x201d;</p><p>North gave the sheriff a grin. &#x201c;Time for another uprisin&#x2019;, I&#x2019;d say.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a court order&#x201d;&#x2014;the sheriff patted his pocket&#x2014;&#x201d;all fit and proper-like. It&#x2019;s my job to execute it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll die first.&#x201d; North raised his musket. &#x201c;And you before me.&#x201d;</p><p>With a sudden clattering of wood, leather, and metal, every deputy leveled a musket at the Pikes. And for a moment, there was quiet.</p><p>The breeze rustled in the trees. A horse snorted. Another pawed the ground.</p><p>Then North said, &#x201c;Seems we has a stand-off.&#x201d;</p><p>And from the house came a voice: &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be no stand-off. You Pike boys stand <i>down</i>. Nobody&#x2019;ll do any dyin&#x2019; on my account.&#x201d;</p><p>Will Pike turned to see his father in the doorway, and after relief poured over him, he filled with a son&#x2019;s pride.</p><p>George North Pike had chosen to dress that day not in the threadbare smallclothes of a bankrupt farmer but in the uniform of a captain in the Massachusetts Artillery. It did not fit him so well as it had when the war ended, for an ague of the stomach had taken twenty pounds off his frame. But the uniform had its effect. No deputy would point a weapon at the blue-and-buff.</p><p>The elder Pike strode out of the house, as if determined to show his best face. He stopped beside his sons and said, &#x201c;Sheriff, my boys think we&#x2019;ve traded bad masters in Britain for worse masters in Boston.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn right,&#x201d; said North, the only man still pointing a musket at anyone.</p><p>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; said George North Pike, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll not rebel against the country I fought for.&#x201d;</p><p>He lifted the musket from North&#x2019;s hands, blew into the pan, and sent up a little cloud of priming powder. He tossed the gun back to his son.</p><p>Then he said, &#x201c;My boys been raised right, Chauncey. They know that this is a government of laws, and laws are made by men, and men might not always be what God intended them to be, but men like you and me, we&#x2019;re decent, just the same.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I appreciate the sentiment, Captain,&#x201d; said Chauncey Yates. &#x201c;Now will you mount the horse we brought for you?&#x201d;</p><p>George North Pike tugged at his waistcoat and looked at his sons. &#x201c;Boys, the livestock been sold off, but we still have our land. So tend to it while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll go with you,&#x201d; said North.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll help you get settled,&#x201d; added Will.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Their father mounted the horse. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll not have you see me in stripes just yet. Let me try them on first.&#x201d;</p><p>And the Pike brothers watched their father ride away at the head of that little group, as though he were their leader rather than their prisoner.</p><p>Then North spat and said, &#x201c;Time for an uprisin&#x2019;.&#x201d;</p><p>THERE WAS NOT much to the town of Pelham. On the west were rocky farms, a tavern, a Congregational meetinghouse at the crossroads. Then the east-west road dipped down to a plank bridge that crossed the Swift River, a narrow stream that lived up to its name even in the driest summers. Just beyond, the road rose toward more rocky farms. But right at the bridge was Conkey&#x2019;s Tavern.</p><p>That was where the Pike brothers headed come sundown.</p><p>&#x201c;A man shouldn&#x2019;t go to bed dry,&#x201d; said North, &#x201c;especially on a day like this. So let&#x2019;s wet our throats and dream of wet quims, which be a bit scarce hereabouts.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that why you went wanderin&#x2019; after the war?&#x201d; asked Will. &#x201c;For the quims?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Once you&#x2019;ve marched with the Continental Army, coaxin&#x2019; corn out of a rocky hillside don&#x2019;t hold much attraction. And once you&#x2019;ve sampled a few of the ladies who follow an army, coaxin&#x2019; a kiss from a neighbor girl ain&#x2019;t quite enough to slake your thirst for somethin&#x2019;... wet and juicy.&#x201d;</p><p>Will thought every night about things wet and juicy, and he envied his brother&#x2019;s knowledge. He had never yet inspired any of the neighbor girls to kiss him, not that there were many.</p><p>And for certain there were none at the tavern, which was full of loud voices and strong opinions and the strong smells of men who spent their days sweating hard under a hot sun. But when the Pikes entered, it was as if the stifling air were blown off by a wind, cold and ominous.</p><p>One by one, then group by group, men fell silent and turned. None had quarrel with the Pikes. But the Pikes reminded them of what they all faced&#x2014;heavy taxes, a Boston government more responsive to the needs of merchants than of self-sufficient farmers, and financial ruin.</p><p>When the room was dead quiet and all eyes were on the Pikes, North announced, &#x201c;Time for an uprisin&#x2019;, boys.&#x201d;</p><p>In an instant, they were crowding around, offering condolences and congratulations. Word of George North Pike&#x2019;s pride, even in disgrace, had already spread.</p><p>Daniel Shays, who farmed a plot as bad as the Pikes&#x2019;, swept two mugs of flip from the bar and gave one to each of them. &#x201c;Your pa&#x2019;s a good man.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A good man indeed,&#x201d; said Doc Hines. He set the broken bones of Pelham and, as Town Moderator, set the political discussion as well.</p><p>North looked around and asked, &#x201c;So who&#x2019;s to lead the uprisin&#x2019;? You, Dan&#x2019;l?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not me.&#x201d; Shays shook his head.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve asked him,&#x201d; said Doc Hines &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been to debtor&#x2019;s court himself, so he knows how humiliatin&#x2019; it is.

At Lake Otsego, during the French and Indian Wars, great frontiersman Natty Bumppo forsakes his love to come to the aid of Thomas Hutter, a trapper under the attack of Iroquois Indians. Published in 1841,&nbsp;<i>The Deerslayer</i>&nbsp;is the first of the Leatherstocking Tales, which reveal the courageous and perseverant nature of the pioneer. Recognized for his descriptive power, Cooper created in Natty Bumppo a mythical character - one of the most significant in the history of American literature. The text of this book was approved by the Center for Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association and published in hardcover by the State University of New York Press.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>The deadly crack of a long rifle and the piercing cries of Indians on the warpath shatter the serenity of beautiful lake Glimmerglass. Danger has invaded the vast forests of upper New York State as Deerslayer and his loyal Mohican friend Chingachgook attempt the daring rescue of an Indian maiden imprisoned in a Huron camp. Soon they are caught in the crossfire between a cunning enemy and two white bounty hunters who mercilessly kill for profit. The last of the Leatherstocking tales to be written, though first in the chronology of the hero's life, <i>The Deerslayer</i> is James Fenimore Cooper's masterpiece. A fine combination of romance, adventure, and morality; this classic novel of the frontier is an eloquent beginning for Cooper's great wilderness saga--and an unforgettable introduction to the famous character who has said to embody the conscience of America: the noble woodsman Deerslayer.Set during the French and Indian Wars, The Deerslayer vividly captures the essence of both the murderous humanity and the natural beauty that distinguished America's founding. The last of Cooper's famous Leatherstocking Tales, it is first chronologically in the frontier adventures of the backwoods scout Natty Bumppo. Amid a terrain largely inspired by Cooper's own boyhood, Natty's initiation in the moral codes of wilderness society is examined in what is, according to D. H. Lawrence, "the loveliest and best" of the Leatherstocking series. <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the definitive text established by James Franklin Beard and James P.

We&#x2019;re standing on a street corner in downtown Kabul. The traffic around us is a tempest of battered 1970s Toyotas occasionally punctuated by a U.N. Land Cruiser or an American Suburban. We&#x2019;re trying to find a taxi driver who knows the back road to Bagram, a road that has been so dangerous for so long that driving on it would have been unthinkable until recently. We need to find someone who remembers the route from before the Soviet invasion in 1979. An old man.</p><p>Eventually we find a driver who knows the road and wants $15 to make the trip, a week&#x2019;s salary for someone lucky enough to have a steady job outside the opium business. We get into the man&#x2019;s beat-up Toyota wagon and bounce toward Kabul&#x2019;s outskirts. At the traffic circle near the military&#x2019;s heavily fortified Kabul Compound around the corner from the bunker-like American embassy, we see a two-story-high paint-chipped and weathered sign instructing locals to turn in any terrorists they may know.</p><p>Kabul itself is occupied by a gaggle of American military units, private military contractors, European troops from the International Security Forces, United Nations development outfits, and other assorted nongovernmental organizations, but their trappings fade away as our cab drives northeast past the airport toward the back road to Bagram. Once we&#x2019;re outside town, houses give way to sprawling junkyards erected <i>Mad Max</i>-style on the Afghan plains. Guard towers protect the compounds&#x2019; precious scrap metal and junk. Solitary furnaces from distant brick factories lace the air with black smoke. A few oversized pickup trucks with homemade turquoise-blue paint jobs adorned with intricate gold and red markings ramble past, their backs overladen with burlap sacks bearing food from Afghanistan&#x2019;s agrarian bread-basket to the north.</p><p>After ten dusty miles, the walls of a compound rise in the distance, and we come to an old-world traffic jam: an elderly shepherd wearing baggy Afghan garb herding a flock of goats across the battered road. The man turns around to look at us. He&#x2019;s wearing a baseball hat. Unusual attire for a traditional Afghan, to say the least. Emblazoned on his cap are the same initials I&#x2019;d seen printed on identity cards hanging from the necks of Bagram-bound contractors in Dubai. KBR: Kellogg Brown and Root, the construction firm that had until recently been a subsidiary of Halliburton, Dick Cheney&#x2019;s old company.</p><p>And there it is in the distance. The top of the crumbling old brick factory once known as the Hecht-hochtief, which found new purpose as one of the first black sites of the war on terror&#x2019;s geography. A secret prison called the Salt Pit, built shortly after September 11 as the Northern Alliance, the CIA, and American Special Forces fanned though Afghanistan. Like so many other secret places, it had been built as a &#x201c;temporary&#x201d; facility but stayed open long after the initial invasion was complete, eventually holding scores of the CIA&#x2019;s &#x201c;ghost&#x201d; prisoners who&#x2019;d been &#x201c;rendered&#x201d; from all over the world. When the CIA abducted a man named Khaled El-Masri from Macedonia and brought him here, his black-clad interrogators told him that he &#x201c;was in Afghanistan, where there are no laws . . . &#x2018;We can do with you whatever we want.&#x2019; &#x201d;</p><p>What was once a single, crumbling building was now an entire complex spanning dozens of acres and surrounded by high brick walls and a barbed wire fence. Outside the walled gates was another wind-blasted and paint-chipped sign in Dari and English: NO PHOTOGRAPHY. I start snapping pictures.</p><p>Black SUVs pull out from the far side of the compound, a tell-tale sign of some kind of &#x201c;special&#x201d; American unit: CIA, Special Forces, or contractor. Realizing that there&#x2019;s a checkpoint ahead, I pull out the memory card on my camera, stash it under the car seat, then pull out another and shoot off a few more pictures. If the guards demand to see what pictures I&#x2019;ve taken, they will see that I have indeed taken forbidden photographs. I plan to play dumb. I&#x2019;ll pretend not to have seen the billboard-sized sign, admit to taking the photos, and apologetically erase them or forfeit the camera and memory card. The good stuff will be safely under the car seat. The images on the card are far more valuable to me than the easily replaceable camera equipment.</p><p>But none of that will be necessary. As we pull up toward the ramshackle checkpoint, the rail-thin Afghan guard lazily asks where we&#x2019;re going. Maiwand tells them we&#x2019;re going back to Kabul.</p><p>&#x201c;What is this place?&#x201d; we ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Training facility,&#x201d; says the disinterested guard.</p><p>&#x201c;Are there Americans here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, lots of Americans.&#x201d;</p><p>We turn around to go back the way we came; two Humvees painted desert-tan pass by.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Every year, the United States spends more than $50 billion to fund a secret world of classified military and intelligence activities, a world of secret airplanes and unacknowledged spacecraft, &#x201c;black&#x201d; military units and covert prisons, a secret geography that military and intelligence insiders call the &#x201c;black world.&#x201d;</p><p>It is a global world. It extends from secret prisons in dusty Afghan hinterlands to ice-encrusted radomes near the North Pole, and from remote eavesdropping stations in the Australian outback to makeshift camps and dirt landing strips in South American jungles. But this black world is more than a collection of places. It is an economy of secret dollars, a world of security clearances and secrecy oaths, code names and classifications tucked away in archives larger than the nation&#x2019;s greatest libraries.</p><p>But you don&#x2019;t have to scour the earth&#x2019;s corners to find the blank spots on maps characterizing this secret world. The vast majority of this secret world is not found in the remote corners of the earth, but is instead startlingly close to home. And its scale is tremendous.</p><p>Approximately <i>four million</i> people in the United States hold security clearances to work on classified projects in the black world. By way of contrast, the federal government employs approximately 1.8 million civilians in the &#x201c;white&#x201d; world. The black world, then, represents millions of jobs. It also represents accumulated knowledge and history.</p><p>A 2004 study by Peter Galison at Harvard University concluded that, in terms of information, the &#x201c;classified universe as it is sometimes called is certainly not smaller, and very probably much larger than this unclassified one.&#x201d; Using data from 2001, Galison noted that there were 33 million classification actions. Assuming that each action represented, on average, ten pages, he deduced that 330 million pages were classified that year. About 80 million were declassified, leaving a net gain of about 250 million classified pages in secret archives. Galison found that if you measure accumulated human knowledge by numbers of pages, the amount of classified knowledge produced in a single year is about five times as great as the amount of knowledge going into the world&#x2019;s greatest repositories of public knowledge. And the classified universe continues to expand.</p><p>This book is a guide to the geography of the classified universe, a circumnavigation of the black world, and an examination of the secret state that has grown and matured as a shadow part of the American government.</p><p><b>1</b></p><p><b>Facts on the Ground</b></p><p>Berkeley</p><p>The geography department at U.C. Berkeley lies on the relatively quiet north side of campus near the corner of Hearst and Euclid avenues in a building named after a former CIA director. The department&#x2019;s home is on the fifth floor of McCone Hall, a name commemorating John McCone, whom Kennedy appointed CIA head after the Bay of Pigs disaster. Having a geography building named after a CIA director somehow makes sense. The building, after all, plays host to a handful of social scientists who spend much of their time traveling around the world, collecting, analyzing, and publishing information about faraway, and sometimes not so faraway, places. A social scientist&#x2019;s work can be remarkably close to that of an intelligence analyst for the CIA or NSA. The lines separating academia from state power can get exceptionally blurry. Across campus from the geography department, at the Boalt law school on the corner of Bancroft and Piedmont avenues on the eighth floor of Simon Hall, is the office of John Yoo. While working in the Bush administration&#x2019;s Office of Legal Counsel, Yoo authored legal opinions authorizing everything from CIA renditions to &#x201c;enhanced interrogation techniques&#x201d; to warrantless surveillance of Americans by the National Security Agency. Upon leaving the Bush administration in 2003, Yoo returned to his professorship at Berkeley. In an age where information is power, it doesn&#x2019;t take much investigative work to find all sorts of connections among the academy, the military, and the intelligence industries. One doesn&#x2019;t even have to walk across campus. Every spring, like clockwork, recruitment letters from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency show up at McCone Hall, encouraging young scholars to join the intelligence community&#x2019;s own version of the geography department.</p><p>When most people hear the word &#x201c;geography,&#x201d; they&#x2019;re reminded of traumatic elementary school quizzes on the names of rivers, mountain ranges, and state capitals. People think of maps. But although the discipline finds its origins in Renaissance exploration and the imperial mapmakers of royal courts, contemporary geographic research has come a long way. Geographers nowadays do everything from building elaborate digital climate models of potential global warming scenarios to picking through bits of fossilized pollen to reconstruct prehistoric agricultural practices, and from tracing the light-speed flows of international capital to documenting localized effects of nature tourism on sub-Saharan village life. The discipline, in short, accommodates a wide range of research methods and topics all united by the axiom that everything happens somewhere, that all human and natural phenomena have, well, a geography.</p><p>In McCone Hall&#x2019;s basement is the earth sciences library, featuring discipline-specific books and journals; it houses an extensive map collection as well, in a back room filled with flat files. The library&#x2019;s collection also includes an archive of United States Geological Survey (USGS) aerial images, all neatly indexed in an old-fashioned card catalog.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time looking at those aerial images. Years before Google Earth went online, I was using the archive to research prisons. With the onset of the &#x201c;war on drugs&#x201d; in the early 1980s, California had embarked on the largest prison-building project in the history of the world. The state had built thirty-three prisons in just a few decades. Over the previous 132 years, California had built just twelve. The aerial images helped me to understand where prisons were, why they were there, and what made California&#x2019;s newest prisons different from those of the past.</p><p>California&#x2019;s new prisons had little resemblance to their older cousins like Folsom and San Quentin, now immortalized in the songs of Johnny Cash. The new prisons were marvels of engineering, dense prefabricated cities of razor wire and white concrete that could go up at almost a moment&#x2019;s notice. Unlike earlier penitentiaries like ...</p></p><h2>11.22.63</h2><p>On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed forever.

Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students&#x2014;a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning&#x2019;s father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk. Not much later, Jake&#x2019;s friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958.

Peering through a tiny crack in the curtains, I could see the words REGISTERED and INSURED stamped on it in big red letters. For the first time I thought he seemed furtive and nervous, actually looking around at his exterior surroundings instead of at the spooky furniture deep in his head. I knew what was in the package: a 6.5mm Carcano rifle&#x2014;also known as a Mannlicher-Carcano&#x2014;complete with scope, purchased from Klein&#x2019;s Sporting Goods in Chicago. Five minutes after he climbed the outside stairs to the second floor, the gun Lee would use to change history was in a closet above my head. Marina took the famous pictures of him holding it just outside my living room window six days later, but I didn&#x2019;t see it. That was a Sunday, and I was in Jodie. As the tenth grew closer, those weekends with Sadie had become the most important, the <i>dearest,</i> things in my life. <br><br>9 <br><br>I came awake with a jerk, hearing someone mutter &#x201c;Still not too late&#x201d; under his breath. I realized it was me and shut up. <br><br>Sadie murmured some thick protest and turned over in bed. The familiar squeak of the springs locked me in place and time: the Candlewood Bungalows, April 5, 1963. I fumbled my watch from the nightstand and peered at the luminous numbers. It was quarter past two in the morning, which meant it was actually the sixth of April. <br><br><i>Still not too late.</i> <br><br>Not too late for what? To back off, to let well enough alone? Or bad enough, come to that? The idea of backing off was attractive, God knew. If I went ahead and things went wrong, this could be my last night with Sadie. Ever. <br><br><i>Even if you do have to kill him, you don&#x2019;t have to do it right away.</i> <br><br>True enough. Oswald was going to relocate to New Orleans for awhile after the attempt on the general&#x2019;s life&#x2014;another shitty apartment, one I&#x2019;d already visited&#x2014;but not for two weeks. That would give me plenty of time to stop his clock. But I sensed it would be a mistake to wait very long. I might find reasons to keep on waiting. The best one was beside me in this bed: long, lovely, and smoothly naked. Maybe she was just another trap laid by the obdurate past, but that didn&#x2019;t matter, because I loved her. And I could envision a scenario&#x2014;all too clearly&#x2014;where I&#x2019;d have to run after killing Oswald. Run where? Back to Maine, of course. Hoping I could stay ahead of the cops just long enough to get to the rabbit-hole and escape into a future where Sadie Dunhill would be . . . well . . . about eighty years old. If she were alive at all. Given her cigarette habit, that would be like rolling six the hard way. <br><br>I got up and went to the window. Only a few of the bungalows were occupied on this early-spring weekend. There was a mud- or manure-splattered pickup truck with a trailer full of what looked like farm implements behind it. An Indian motorcycle with a sidecar. A couple of station wagons. And a two-tone Plymouth Fury. The moon was sliding in and out of thin clouds and it wasn&#x2019;t possible to make out the color of the car&#x2019;s lower half by that stuttery light, but I was pretty sure I knew what it was, anyway. <br><br>I pulled on my pants, undershirt, and shoes. Then I slipped out of the cabin and walked across the courtyard. The chilly air bit at my bed-warm skin, but I barely felt it. Yes, the car was a Fury, and yes, it was white over red, but this one wasn&#x2019;t from Maine <i>or</i> Arkansas; the plate was Oklahoma, and the decal in the rear window read GO, SOONERS. I peeked in and saw a scatter of textbooks. Some student, maybe headed south to visit his folks on spring break. Or a couple of horny teachers taking advantage of the Candlewood&#x2019;s liberal guest policy. <br><br>Just another not-quite-on-key chime as the past harmonized with itself. I touched the trunk, as I had back in Lisbon Falls, then returned to the bungalow. Sadie had pushed the sheet down to her waist, and when I came in, the draft of cool air woke her up. She sat, holding the sheet over her breasts, then let it drop when she saw it was me. <br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t sleep, honey?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I had a bad dream and went out for some air.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;What was it?&#x201d; <br><br>I unbuttoned my jeans, kicked off my loafers. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Try. My mother always used to say if you tell your dreams, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>I got into bed with her wearing nothing but my undershirt. &#x201c;<i>My</i> mother used to say if you kiss your honey, they won&#x2019;t come true.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Did she actually say that?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said thoughtfully, &#x201c;it sounds possible. Let&#x2019;s try it.&#x201d; <br><br>We tried it. <br><br>One thing led to another. <br><br>10 <br><br>Afterward, she lit a cigarette. I lay watching the smoke drift up and turn blue in the occasional moonlight coming through the half-drawn curtains. <i>I&#x2019;d never leave the curtains that way at Neely Street,</i> I thought. <i>At Neely Street, in my other life, I&#x2019;m always alone but still careful to close them all the way. Except when I&#x2019;m peeking, that is. Lurking.</i> <br><br>Just then I didn&#x2019;t like myself very much. <br><br>&#x201c;George?&#x201d; <br><br>I sighed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not my name.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d; <br><br>I looked at her. She inhaled deeply, enjoying her cigarette guiltlessly, as people do in the Land of Ago. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have any inside information, if that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re thinking. But it stands to reason. The rest of your past is made up, after all. And I&#x2019;m glad. I don&#x2019;t like George all that much. It&#x2019;s kind of . . . what&#x2019;s that word you use sometimes? . . . kind of dorky.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;How does Jake suit you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;As in Jacob?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I like it.&#x201d; She turned to me. &#x201c;In the Bible, Jacob wrestled an angel. And you&#x2019;re wrestling, too. Aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I suppose I am, but not with an angel.&#x201d; Although Lee Oswald didn&#x2019;t make much of a devil, either. I liked George de Mohren--schildt better for the devil role. In the Bible, Satan&#x2019;s a tempter who makes the offer and then stands aside. I hoped de Mohrenschildt was like that. <br><br>Sadie snubbed her cigarette. Her voice was calm, but her eyes were dark. &#x201c;Are you going to be hurt?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Are you going away? Because if you have to go away, I&#x2019;m not sure I can stand it. I would have died before I said it when I was there, but Reno was a nightmare. Losing you for good . . .&#x201d; She shook her head slowly. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m not sure I could stand that.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I want to marry you,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>&#x201c;My God,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;Just when I&#x2019;m ready to say it&#x2019;ll never happen, Jake-alias-George says right now.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not right now, but if the next week goes the way I hope it does . . . will you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Of course. But I <i>do</i> have to ask one teensy question.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Am I single? Legally single? Is that what you want to know?&#x201d; <br><br>She nodded. <br><br>&#x201c;I am,&#x201d; I said. <br><br>She let out a comic sigh and grinned like a kid. Then she sobered. &#x201c;Can I help you? Let me help you.&#x201d; <br><br>The thought turned me cold, and she must have seen it. Her lower lip crept into her mouth. She bit down on it with her teeth. &#x201c;That bad, then,&#x201d; she said musingly. <br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s put it this way: I&#x2019;m currently close to a big machine full of sharp teeth, and it&#x2019;s running full speed. I won&#x2019;t allow you next to me while I&#x2019;m monkeying with it.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;When is it?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Your . . . I don&#x2019;t know . . . your date with destiny?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Still to be determined.&#x201d; I had a feeling that I&#x2019;d said too much already, but since I&#x2019;d come this far, I decided to go a little farther. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s going to happen this Wednesday night. Something I have to witness. Then I&#x2019;ll decide.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Is there no way I can help you?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so, honey.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;If it turns out I can&#x2014;&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I appreciate that. And you really will marry me?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Now that I know your name is Jake? Of course.&#x201d;</p><h2>Sea City, Here We Come!

Original.</p><p></p><h2>Severe Clear (Stone Barrington)</h2><p>Stone Barrington is in Bel-Air, overseeing the grand opening of the ultra-luxe hotel, The Arrington, built on the grounds of the mansion belonging to his late wife, Arrington Carter. The star-studded gala will be attended by socialites, royalty, and billionaires from overseas . . . and according to phone conversations intercepted by the NSA, it may also have attracted the attention of international terrorists. To ensure the safety of his guests&#x20ac;&#x201d;and the city of Los Angeles&#x20ac;&#x201d;Stone may have to call in a few favors from his friends at the CIA. . . .</p><p>Stuart Woods is the author of fifty novels, including the New York Times&#x2013;bestselling Stone Barrington and Holly Barker series. He is a native of Georgia and began his writing career in the advertising industry. Chiefs, his debut in 1981, won the Edgar Award. An avid sailor and pilot, Woods lives in New York City, Florida, and Maine.<b>1</b><p>Scott Hipp turned off I-295 South in Fort Meade, Maryland, at the dedicated exit entitled &#x201c;NSA Employees Only&#x201d; and drove to the mirrored black building that is the headquarters of the National Security Agency. The NSA was that part of the United States intelligence community responsible for communications surveillance and code breaking, and Hipp was its deputy director for cryptology, so he could park in the underground garage instead of in one of the eighteen thousand parking spaces surrounding the building.</p><p>Feeling smug that he would return to a cool automobile instead of one baking outside, he inserted his ID badge in the elevator panel and rode up to his office on the top floor, which he entered at the stroke of eight a.m., as he did every day. Four people awaited him at his conference table, drinking his coffee.</p><p>Hipp set his briefcase on the conference table and sat down. &#x201c;Tell me something I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; he said without preamble.</p><p>The four exchanged some glances and shuffled through their papers.</p><p>Hipp watched them with satisfaction, since he knew they knew there was not much he didn&#x2019;t know.</p><p>&#x201c;How about a cryptology joke?&#x201d; asked one of them, removing a sheet of paper from a stack.</p><p>&#x201c;Amuse me,&#x201d; Hipp said.</p><p>&#x201c;Overnight down at Fort Gordon, one of our computers picked up a twenty-two-second cell phone conversation between someone in Afghanistan and someone in Yemen. The conversation was too brief to pinpoint locations, and much of it was garbled. The funny part is that, in the middle of the conversation, two English words were clearly spoken: &#x2018;the&#x2019; and &#x2018;Arrington.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That is terribly amusing,&#x201d; Hipp said with a straight face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s also very common, since English is a worldwide language, and foreigners often use phrases from or fragments of English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Does anyone at Fort Gordon, or for that matter, anyone here, have any thoughts on what the words mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; the man said, &#x201c;I Googled it and there were essentially four hits, among a lot of duplication: first, there&#x2019;s some techie businessman named Arrington who&#x2019;s apparently famous in that world; second, there&#x2019;s an old Virginia family by that name; third, there&#x2019;s an Arrington vineyard; and fourth, there&#x2019;s a new hotel opening in Los Angeles called The Arrington. I like that one best because it has the &#x2018;The&#x2019; in front of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me about the hotel,&#x201d; Hipp said.</p><p>&#x201c;You remember the movie star Vance Calder, who was murdered some years back? The hotel is being built on the grounds of his former home, something like twenty acres, in Bel-Air, a top-scale residential community in L.A.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Home of the Bel-Air Hotel, I believe,&#x201d; Hipp replied.</p><p>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;The hotel is being named for his widow, n�e Arrington Carter, who herself was murdered early last year. Curiously, both Mr. and Mrs. Calder were murdered by former lovers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Any apparent significance there?&#x201d; Hipp asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not really, just a coincidence. The hotel is having a grand opening soon&#x2014;apparently it&#x2019;s a hot ticket out there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If it&#x2019;s a hot ticket in L.A.,&#x201d; Hipp observed, &#x201c;there are probably not many invitations circulating in either Afghanistan or Yemen.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That occurred to me, sir.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In what language did the cell phone conversation take place?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A combination of Urdu and Arabic. Not enough was captured to make any sense of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; Hipp said. &#x201c;Put &#x2018;The Arrington&#x2019; on the phraseology watch list and let&#x2019;s see if anything pops up. I don&#x2019;t think a single mention of the name is grounds for any sort of alert at this point.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; the man said, scribbling a note on the message and setting it aside.</p><p>The meeting went on for another hour, five men trying to find some evil intent in the overnight traffic. At nine thirty, Hipp closed his briefcase and stood up. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m due at the White House at eleven,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You people finish up somewhere else. I need the office.&#x201d;</p><p>The four men shuffled out, and Hipp spent a few minutes going over calls and correspondence with his secretary.</p><p>Hipp arrived at the White House at ten forty-five and was admitted to the cabinet room in the West Wing. By eleven there were eight representatives of other intelligence and security agencies present, and the president of the United States entered the room on time. Everyone stood, and he told them to sit, and the meeting began.</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>A</b>n hour and twenty minutes later, the meeting broke, and Hipp went down to the White House Mess to get some lunch before driving back to Fort Meade. He chose a table by himself, but a moment later, the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, Tim Coleman, walked up. &#x201c;Hi, Scott. Mind if I join you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even a little bit,&#x201d; Hipp replied.</p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;d your meeting go?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like most meetings&#x2014;nothing monumental was decided. Sometimes I think all this Agency cross-talk has gone too far.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know how you feel,&#x201d; Coleman said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why I wasn&#x2019;t there.&#x201d;</p><p>A Filipino waiter came with menus, and they ordered.</p><p>A discussion of the troubles of Tiger Woods ensued, and the two men agreed that all the man had to do was to win a couple of tournaments and he&#x2019;d be back on track. They were on coffee when Hipp, trying to keep the conversation going, told Coleman about the capture of two English words in a foreign telephone conversation.</p><p>&#x201c;What words?&#x201d; Coleman asked.</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;The Arrington.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>Coleman looked at Hipp. &#x201c;What do you think it means?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Could be a new hotel about to open in L.A.,&#x201d; Hipp said. &#x201c;I put it on the phraseology watch list, and we&#x2019;ll see if it comes up again.&#x201d;</p><p>Coleman stood up. &#x201c;I gotta get back to work, Scott. Good to see you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same here, Tim.&#x201d;</p><p>Coleman turned to go, then stopped. &#x201c;Say, let me know if your watch list catches that phrase again, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>Hipp was about to ask why, but Coleman was already striding across the room.</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>T</b>im Coleman went back to his office, and on the way in he said to one of his secretaries, &#x201c;Get me the director of the Secret Service, please. Right now.&#x201d;</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Stone Barrington arrived at the offices of Strategic Services, his most important legal client, and was shown to a large conference room. A large object under a sheet dominated the table, and half a dozen men and women stood, chatting idly and drinking coffee.</p><p>At the stroke of three p.m. Michael Freeman, chairman and CEO of Strategic Services, the world&#x2019;s second-largest security firm, entered. &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;please be seated.&#x201d; Everyone found a chair.</p><p>&#x201c;I know most of you have already met, but let me take a moment to review. To my immediate right is Stone Barrington, legal counsel to Strategic Services, and the largest individual investor in the hotel. Strategic Services is, of course, a significant investor, as is Superlative Hotel Management, or Super, as we like to call it, and they are represented here by David Connor, CEO, to Stone&#x2019;s right, and by Morton Kaplan, to my left, who is serving as the executive director of our hotel. At the other end of the table are Katie Rogers, Super&#x2019;s marketing director, and Caroline Hugenot, the director of design for the hotel, and finally, Dick Trevor, who leads the architectural team for us.</p><p>&#x201c;I have one more introduction to make. Ladies and gentlemen, The Arrington.&#x201d; Freeman took hold of the sheet covering the object on the table and, with a flourish, whipped it off, revealing a large model of the hotel. Everyone applauded.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you&#x2019;ve all seen the place at some stage of the construction, but this will be the first bird&#x2019;s-eye view that any of us has seen, unless someone owns a helicopter I don&#x2019;t know about.&#x201d; Freeman produced a laser pointer and switched it on.</p><p>&#x201c;The front gate is here, of course, and the drive takes arrivals up the hill to the reception building, which is an expansion of the Vance Calder house and contains the reception desk, concierge staff, phone exchange, bell captain&#x2019;s office with adjacent luggage storage space, and the executive offices. Behind that building, where the Calder pool once was, is the house built for Arrington Carter Barrington and her husband, Stone Barrington, and next to that is the former Calder guest house, now Cottage One.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman continued to point out the new pool, the par-three, nine-hole golf course, the tennis courts, gymnasium, cottages, and buildings containing rooms for both guests and their traveling staffs. &#x201c;Most of the parking is underground, leaving the roads and paths free for the electric carts that will transport guests and their luggage to their accommodations.</p><p>&#x201c;We have an indoor theater seating three hundred people and an outdoor amphitheater built into the hillside that seats fifteen hundred. There is a mini-mall here, containing a spa, hair salon, and eight top-end shops and boutiques. A guest who arrives having lost all his luggage can reequip himself or herself there in an hour or less.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman pointed to two large cottages in a secluded corner of the property. &#x201c;These are our two presidential cottages, and after weeks of diplomacy, negotiation, and security planning, I can finally divulge what most of you do not know: two days before our grand opening, the presidents of the United States and Mexico will meet to conduct final negotiations and the signing of a new trade and immigration treaty between the two countries, covering all sorts of things that you will read about in the newspapers. Additionally, both presidents will attend our grand opening celebration.</p><p>&#x201c;The Arrington is an ideal location for such a meeting, especially since it will not yet have any guests except Stone Barrington and his party, and I can assure you that between the United States Secret Service and the people of Strategic Services, there will be security rivaling that of the White House.&#x201d;</p><p>More applause and happy smiles.</p><p>&#x201c;There are two hundred suites, fifty rooms, three restaurants, and everything else a guest&#x2019;s heart could desire. As you may know, Centurion Studios has underwritten the grand opening celebration, and they have taken twenty-five suites for that night. Many of their out-of-town guests will be staying on for some days. Centurion has also seen that the crowd attending the celebration will be a star-studded one. One thousand invitations were sent out all over this country and the world, and I&#x2019;m told that there have been more than nine hundred acceptances. Before you ask, the invitation list is now closed, but then you all had the opportunity of inviting guests.</p><p>&#x201c;Now, I&#x2019;d like to ask Mort Kaplan to take us through the schedule of events on opening day.&#x201d;</p><p>* * *</p><p><b>K</b>aplan stood up. He was a tall, slender, handsome man of around fifty in a Savile Row suit and a tan. &#x201c;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.&#x201d; Kaplan took them, step by step, through the schedule of the opening day and gave them their suite assignments. &#x201c;Since all of our guests will be arriving on the same day, I would be grateful if you could check into the hotel with your luggage the previous day. The Secret Service will have your names at the gate. We&#x2019;ve rented a fleet of golf carts, which will bear our logo, to supplement our own fleet of electric vehicles, so that will help us deal with the rush. We will also have a dozen check-in stations at the front desk, instead of the usual four. Each guest will receive a rather expensive gift box and a packet of information, including a map of the property, table assignment for dinner, and other amenities.&#x201d;</p><p>Kaplan continued for most of an hour, then thanked everyone and sat down.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Mort,&#x201d; Freeman said. &#x201c;That was very impressive, and I&#x2019;m sure everything will go smoothly. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our meeting. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll see you all at the grand opening.&#x201d;</p><p>The group chatted among themselves for a few minutes, then filed out and headed for the elevators. Mike Freeman tugged at Stone&#x2019;s sleeve. &#x201c;Stick around for a minute, will you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure, Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>Freeman closed the conference room door and waved Stone to a seat.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re looking very serious, Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m feeling very serious,&#x201d; he replied.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a phone call this morning, a conference call, actually, with the director of the Secret Service, Howard Carroll, and the president&#x2019;s chief of staff, Tim Coleman, whom I believe you know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know Coleman, but not Carroll.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They told me that an NSA computer recorded a cell phone conversation between someone in Afghanistan and someone in Yemen. Most of it was garbled, but the words &#x2018;The Arrington&#x2019; in English were discernible.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s disturbing,&#x201d; Stone said, and he felt it.</p><p>&#x201c;Both the White House and the Secret Service feel that a single mention of the hotel&#x2019;s name is not necessarily significant, and they&#x2019;ve put the name on a kind of electronic watch list to see if there&#x2019;s any further chat about it. In the meantime, nobody is panicking&#x2014;yet&#x2014;but we&#x2019;ve agreed that our security for the grand opening should be stepped up even above the present level. We&#x2019;ve twenty-five of our people assigned to the event, and I&#x2019;ve told them I would speak with you and request that another twenty-five of our agents be assigned, plus half a dozen more to serve in the security center, monitoring the hundred and fifty high-definition cameras we have installed around the property.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m certainly agreeable to that and anything else you feel we need,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;And I think we&#x2019;re fortunate to have you as a principal in the hotel.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Stone, I&#x2019;ll see to it. When I told the others that our security at the hotel is nearly at White House levels, I wasn&#x2019;t kidding, and now we&#x2019;re ratcheting it up a couple of notches. We&#x2019;ve already made the perimeter of the property highly secure, and there are only four access points, which will be beefed up with concrete barriers.

Always concerns with the effectiveness of the lessons, Jones introduces readers to the Greek alphabet, explains each grammar point in layman&#39;s terms, gives plenty of study hints, provides answers for the exercises (please don&#39;t peek until you try them) and even presents a &#34;to-do&#34; list at the end of most chapters.

Now, for the first time in paperback, The Lyons Press brings Marinaro's intense and remarkable originality to a second book of profound significance. <p>Marinaro's approach is nothing short of revolutionary. His startling high-speed color photographs explore the feeding patterns and behavior of the trout, revealing unsuspected responses that the fisherman can exploit with new tactics and new fly patterns. In addition, he provides a novel and unique way of testing fly patterns, the "game of nods"; a fresh look at rod design; new revelations about the spinner; an expanded treatment of his pathbreaking study of the Caenis; and further explorations with terrestrials. There is also a special discussion of limestone and freestone rivers.</p></p><p>A thoughtful fisherman and a fine photographer, Marinaro sets out to debunk the mystery of the trout's environment and feeding behavior. "A trout lives in a secret world," he writes. "It is a small world in which many dramatic events are played out in watery obscurity, veiled from the keenest eyes. And even though he is stalked and pursued relentlessly by the most attentive land creature on earth, his life-style remains much of a mystery." Marinaro begins to reveal the mystery through the clarity of his own sharp vision and the technological wizardry of a high-speed camera--both of which are focused on the ring of the rise, or <i>riseform</i>, which is, in essence, the trout's dining room. "A trout is vulnerable to the fisherman because he eats," Marinaro explains, and by trying to visually parse what the trout sees from what he doesn't see (how the fish moves toward his dinner and how he takes it) the author ushers us directly to the dining room table to understand what happens when a fish is presented with a fly--his supper--from the fish's point of view. Marinaro's skill at identifying a trout's myriad feeding patterns, and his ability to decode them, is precisely the kind of knowledge the studious angler salivates over. Used cunningly, it translates into an engraved dinner invitation for delivery on the end of a hook. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><h2>Behold the Beauty of the Lord</h2><p>This is a book of meditations penned by famed Catholic writer Henri Nouwen, growing out of his contemplation of icons during sojourns at l&#39;Arche, a community for people with mental handicaps in Trosly, France.</p><p><b>Henri J.

This paperback is a revised version of a volume released in 1987.<br><br>We are assaulted by images in a society where consumerism comes at us through posters, billboards, television, movies and store windows. But icons are a different thing completely. Nouwen presents meditations on four icons: the icon of the Holy Trinity, the icon of the Virgin of Vladimir, the icon of the Savior of Zvenigorod, and the icon of the Descent of the Spirit:<br><br>"By giving the icons long and prayerful attention talking about them, reading about them, but mostly just gazing at them in silence I have gradually come to know them by heart. I see them now whether they are physically present or not. I have memorized them as I have memorized the Our Father and the Hail Mary, and I pray with them wherever I go."<br><br>Icons are a part of the sacred liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and are used in worship services. Nouwen points out that they do not excite our outer senses but speak to our heart. Those who gaze at icons as a spiritual practice believe they draw closer to God in the process. Nouwen presents substantive spiritual analysis of the icon of the Holy Trinity, which he sees as a pathway into the Mystery of God's self-revelation. The icon of the Virgin of Vladimir is an invitation to enter the divine milieu with gratitude and joy. Nouwen sees in the eyes of the icon of the Savior of Zvenigorod a revelation about the mystery of the Incarnation. And, finally, in the icon of the Descent of the Holy Spirit, he feels a celebration of the power and meaning of community. Nouwen concludes:<br><br>"Working on these meditations has been a great delight. Praying became writing and writing became praying. More energy was granted than consumed in the process. I fervently hope that you who read these meditations will experience some of this same delight, and thus deepen your desire to behold the beauty of the Lord expressed in these holy images." --<b>Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat</b>, spiritualityandpractice.com</p><h2>Faith Versus Fact: Why Science and Religion Are Incompatible</h2><p><b>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author explains why any attempt to make religion compatible with science is doomed to fail.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> What we read in the news today is full of subjectivity, half-truths, and blatant falsehoods; and thus it is more necessary now than ever to safeguard the truth with <i>facts</i>. In his provocative new book, evolutionary biologist Jerry A. Coyne aims to do exactly that in the arena of religion. In clear, dispassionate detail he explains why the toolkit of science, based on reason and empirical study, is reliable, while that of religion&#x2014;including faith, dogma, and revelation&#x2014;leads to incorrect, untestable, or conflicting conclusions.<br> &nbsp;<br> Coyne is responding to a national climate in which over half of Americans don&#x2019;t believe in evolution (and congressmen deny global warming), and warns that religious prejudices and strictures in politics, education, medicine, and social policy are on the rise. Extending the bestselling works of Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens, he demolishes the claims of religion to provide verifiable &#x201c;truth&#x201d; by subjecting those claims to the same tests we use to establish truth in science.<br> &nbsp;<br> Coyne irrefutably demonstrates the grave harm&#x2014;to individuals and to our planet&#x2014;in mistaking faith for fact in making the most important decisions about the world we live in.</p><p><b>Jerry A. Coyne</b> is professor emeritus at the University of Chicago in the Department of Ecology and Evolution, where he specialized in evolutionary genetics. His <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, <i>Why Evolution Is True,</i> was one of <i>Newsweek</i>&#x2019;s &#x201c;50 Books for Our Times&#x201d; in 2010.<p></p><p>PREFACE</p><p>The Genesis of This Book</p><p>&#x2014;Neil deGrasse Tyson</p><p>In February 2013, I debated a young Lutheran theologian on a hot-button topic: &#x201c;Are science and religion compatible?&#x201d; The site was the historic Circular Congregational Church in Charleston, South Carolina, one of the oldest churches in the American South. After both of us gave our twenty-minute spiels (she argued &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; while I said &#x201c;no&#x201d;), we were asked to sum up our views in a single sentence. I can&#x2019;t remember my own pr�cis, but I clearly recall the theologian&#x2019;s words: &#x201c;We must always remember that faith is a gift.&#x201d;</p><p>This was one of those <i>l&#x2019;esprit d&#x2019;escalier,</i> or &#x201c;wit of the staircase,&#x201d; moments, when you come up with the perfect response&#x2014;but only well after the opportunity has passed. For shortly after the debate was over, I not only remembered that <i>Gift</i> is the German word for &#x201c;poison,&#x201d; but saw clearly that the theologian&#x2019;s parting words undercut her very thesis that science and religion are compatible. Whatever I actually said, what I <i>should</i> have said was this: &#x201c;Faith may be a gift in religion, but in science it&#x2019;s poison, for faith is no way to find truth.&#x201d;</p><p>This book gives me a chance to say that now. It is about the different ways that science and religion regard faith, ways that make them incompatible for discovering what&#x2019;s true about our universe. My thesis is that religion and science compete in many ways to describe reality&#x2014;they both make &#x201c;existence claims&#x201d; about what is real&#x2014;but use different tools to meet this goal. And I argue that the toolkit of science, based on reason and empirical study, is reliable, while that of religion&#x2014;including faith, dogma, and revelation&#x2014;is unreliable and leads to incorrect, untestable, or conflicting conclusions. Indeed, by relying on faith rather than evidence, religion renders itself <i>incapable</i> of finding truth.</p><p>I maintain, then&#x2014;and here I diverge from the many &#x201c;accommodationists&#x201d; who see religion and science, if not harmonious or complementary, at least as not in conflict&#x2014;that religion and science are engaged in a kind of war: a war for understanding, a war about whether we should have good reasons for what we accept as true.</p><p>Although this book deals with the conflict between religion and science, I see this as only one battle in a wider war&#x2014;a war between rationality and superstition. Religion is but a single brand of superstition (others include beliefs in astrology, paranormal phenomena, homeopathy, and spiritual healing), but it is the most widespread and harmful form of superstition. And science is but one form of rationality (philosophy and mathematics are others), but it is a highly developed form, and the only one capable of describing and understanding reality. All superstitions that <i>purport</i> to give truths are actually forms of pseudoscience, and all use similar tactics to immunize themselves against disproof. As we&#x2019;ll see, advocates of pseudosciences like homeopathy or ESP often support their beliefs using the same arguments employed by theologians to defend their faith.</p><p>While the science-versus-religion debate is one battle in the war between rationality and irrationality, I concentrate on it for several reasons. First, the controversy has become more widespread and visible, most likely because of a new element in the criticism of religion. The most novel aspect of &#x201c;New Atheism&#x201d;&#x2014;the form of disbelief that distinguishes the views of writers like Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins from the &#x201c;old&#x201d; atheism of people like Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell&#x2014;is the observation that most religions are grounded in claims that can be regarded as <i>scientific. </i>That is,<i> </i>God, and the tenets of many religions, are <i>hypotheses</i> that can, at least in principle, be examined by science and reason. If religious claims can&#x2019;t be substantiated with reliable evidence, the argument goes, they should, like dubious scientific claims, be rejected until more data arrive. This argument is buttressed by new developments in science, in areas like cosmology, neurobiology, and evolutionary biology. Discoveries in those fields have undermined religious claims that phenomena like the origin of the universe and the existence of human morality and consciousness defy scientific explanation and are therefore evidence for God. Seeing their bailiwick shrinking, the faithful have become more insistent that religion is actually a way of understanding nature that complements science. But the most important reason to concentrate on religion rather than other forms of irrationality is not to document a historical conflict, but because, among all forms of superstition, religion has by far the most potential for public harm. Few are damaged by belief in astrology; but, as we&#x2019;ll see in the final chapter, many have been harmed by belief in a particular god or by the idea that faith is a virtue.</p><p>I have both a personal and a professional interest in this argument, for I&#x2019;ve spent my adult life teaching and studying evolutionary biology, the brand of science most vilified and rejected by religion. And a bit more biography is in order: I was raised as a secular Jew, an upbringing that, as most people know, is but a hairsbreadth from atheism. But my vague beliefs in a God were abandoned almost instantly when, at seventeen, I was listening to the Beatles&#x2019; <i>Sergeant Pepper</i> album and suddenly realized that there was simply no evidence for the religious claims I had been taught&#x2014;or for anybody else&#x2019;s, either. From the beginning, then, my unbelief rested on an absence of evidence for anything divine. Compared with that of many believers, my rejection of God was brief and painless. But after that I didn&#x2019;t think much about religion until I became a professional scientist.</p><p>There&#x2019;s no surer route to immersion in the conflict between science and religion than becoming an evolutionary biologist. Nearly half of Americans reject evolution completely, espousing a biblical literalism in which every living species, or at least our own, was suddenly created from nothing less than ten thousand years ago by a divine being. And most of the rest believe that God <i>guided</i> evolution one way or another&#x2014;a position that flatly rejects the naturalistic view accepted by evolutionary biologists: that evolution, like all phenomena in the universe, is a consequence of the laws of physics, without supernatural involvement. In fact, only about one in five Americans accepts evolution in the purely naturalistic way scientists see it.</p><p>When I taught my first course in evolution at the University of Maryland, I could hear the opposition directly, for in the plaza right below my classroom a preacher would often hold forth loudly about how evolution was a tool of Satan. And many of my own students, while dutifully learning about evolution, made it clear that they didn&#x2019;t believe a word of it. Curious about how such opposition could exist despite the copious evidence for evolution, I began reading about creationism. It was immediately evident that virtually all opposition to evolution comes from religion. In fact, among the dozens of prominent creationists I&#x2019;ve encountered, I&#x2019;ve known of only one&#x2014;the philosopher David Berlinski&#x2014;whose view isn&#x2019;t motivated by religion.</p><p>Finally, after twenty-five years of teaching, facing pushback all the way, I decided to address the problem of creationism in the only way I knew: by writing a popular book laying out the evidence for evolution. And there were mountains of evidence, drawn from the fossil record, embryology, molecular biology, the geography of plants and animals, the development and construction of animal bodies, and so on. Curiously, nobody had written such a book. Practical people, I figured&#x2014;or even skeptical ones&#x2014;would surely come around to accepting the scientific view of evolution once they&#x2019;d seen the evidence laid out in black and white.</p><p>I was wrong. Although my book, <i>Why Evolution Is True,</i> did well (even nosing briefly onto the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list), and although I received quite a few letters from religious readers telling me I&#x2019;d &#x201c;converted&#x201d; them to evolution, the proportion of creationists in America didn&#x2019;t budge: for thirty-two years it&#x2019;s hovered between 40 and 46 percent.</p><p>It didn&#x2019;t take long to realize the futility of using evidence to sell evolution to Americans, for faith led them to discount and reject the facts right before their noses. In my earlier book I recounted the &#x201c;aha&#x201d; moment when I realized this. A group of businessmen in a ritzy suburb of Chicago, wanting to learn some science as a respite from shoptalk, invited me to talk to them about evolution at their weekly luncheon. I gave them a lavishly illustrated lecture about the evidence for evolution, complete with photos of transitional fossils, vestigial organs, and developmental anomalies like the vanishing leg buds of embryonic dolphins. They seemed to appreciate my efforts. But after the talk, one of the attendees approached me, shook my hand, and said, &#x201c;Dr. Coyne, I found your evidence for evolution very convincing&#x2014;but I still don&#x2019;t believe it.&#x201d;</p><p>I was flabbergasted. How could it be that someone found evidence convincing but <i>was still not convinced</i>? The answer, of course, was that his religion had immunized him against my evidence.</p><p>As a scientist brought up without much religious indoctrination, I couldn&#x2019;t understand how <i>anything</i> could blinker people against hard data and strong evidence. Why couldn&#x2019;t people be religious and still accept evolution? That question led me to the extensive literature on the relationship between science and religion, and the discovery that much of it is indeed what I call &#x201c;accommodationist&#x201d;: seeing the two areas as compatible, mutually supportive, or at least not in conflict. But as I dug deeper, and began to read theology as well, I realized that there were intractable incompatibilities between science and religion, ones glossed over or avoided in the accommodationist literature.</p><p>Further, I began to see that theology itself, or at least the truth claims religion makes about the universe, turns it into a kind of science, but a science using weak evidence to make strong statements about what is true. As a scientist, I saw deep parallels between theology&#x2019;s empirical and reason-based justifications for belief and the kind of tactics used by pseudoscientists to defend their turf. One of these is an a priori<i> </i>commitment to defend and justify one&#x2019;s preferred claims, something that stands in strong contrast to science&#x2019;s practice of constantly testing whether its claims might be wrong. Yet religious people were staking their very lives and futures on evidence that wouldn&#x2019;t come close to, say, the kind of data the U.S. government requires before approving a new drug for depression. In the end I saw that the claims for the compatibility of science and religion were weak, resting on assertions about the nature of religion that few believers really accept, and that religion could never be made compatible with science without diluting it so seriously that it was no longer religion but a humanist philosophy.</p><p>And so I learned what other opponents of creationism could have told me: that persuading Americans to accept the truth of evolution involved not just an education in facts, but a de-education in faith&#x2014;the form of belief that replaces the need for evidence with simple emotional commitment. I will try to convince you that religion, as practiced by most believers, is severely at odds with science, and that this conflict is damaging to science itself, to how the public conceives of science, and to what the public thinks science can and cannot not tell us. I&#x2019;ll also argue that the claim that religion and science are complementary &#x201c;ways of knowing&#x201d; gives unwarranted credibility to faith, a credibility that, at its extremes, is responsible for many human deaths and might ultimately contribute to the demise of our own species and much other life on Earth.</p><p>Science and religion, then, are competitors in the business of finding out what is true about our universe. In this goal religion has failed miserably, for its tools for discerning &#x201c;truth&#x201d; are useless. These areas are incompatible in precisely the same way, and in the same sense, that rationality is incompatible with irrationality.</p><p>Let me hasten, though, to add a few caveats.</p><p>First, some &#x201c;religions,&#x201d; like Jainism and the more meditation-oriented versions of Buddhism, make few or no claims about what exists in the universe. (I&#x2019;ll shortly give a definition of &#x201c;religion&#x201d; so that my thesis becomes clear.) Adherents to other faiths, like Quakers and Unitarian Universalists, are heterogeneous, with some &#x201c;believers&#x201d; being indistinguishable from agnostics or atheists who practice a nebulous but godless spirituality. As the beliefs of such people are often not <i>theistic</i> (that is, they don&#x2019;t involve a deity that interacts with the world), there is less chance that they will conflict with science. This book deals largely with theistic faiths. They&#x2019;re not the totality of religions, but they constitute by far the largest number of religions&#x2014;and believers&#x2014;on Earth.</p><p>For several reasons I concentrate on the Abrahamic faiths: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Those are the religions I know most about, and, more important, are the ones&#x2014;particularly Christianity&#x2014;most concerned with reconciling their beliefs with science. While I discuss other faiths in passing, it is mostly the various brands of Christianity that occupy this book. Likewise, I will talk mostly about science and religion in the United States, for here is where their conflict is most visible. The problem is less pressing in Europe because the proportion of theists, particularly in northern Europe, is much lower than in America. In the Middle East, on the other hand, where Islam is truly and deeply in conflict with science, such discussions are often seen as heretical.</p><p>Finally, there are some versions of even the Abrahamic religions whose tenets are so vague that it&#x2019;s simply unclear whether they conflict with science. Apophatic, or &#x201c;negative,&#x201d; theology, for instance, is reluctant to make claims about the nature or even the existence of a god. Some liberal Christians speak of God as a &#x201c;ground of being&#x201d; rather than as an entity with humanlike feelings and properties that behaves in specified ways. While some theologians claim that these are the &#x201c;strongest&#x201d; notions of God, they have that status only because they make the fewest claims and are thus the least susceptible to refutation&#x2014;or even discussion. For anyone having the least familiarity with religion, it goes without saying that such watered-down versions of faith are not held by most people, who accept instead a personal god who intervenes in the world.</p><p>This brings us to the common claim that critics of religion accept a &#x201c;straw man&#x201d; fallacy, seeing all believers as fundamentalists or scriptural literalists, and that we neglect the &#x201c;strong and sophisticated&#x201d; versions of faith held by liberal theologians. A true discussion of faith/science compatibility, this argument runs, demands that we deal only with these sophisticated forms of belief. For if we construe &#x201c;religion&#x201d; as simply &#x201c;the beliefs of the average believer,&#x201d; then arguing that those beliefs are incompatible with scien...</p></p><h2>No Nest for the Wicket (Meg Langslow Mysteries)</h2><p>Croquet is a genteel game, usually played on a summer afternoon on a tranquil green lawn.

First serial, Newsweek. BOMC Feat Alt. QPB Alt.</p><p>In a stunning feat of meticulous reportage, Pulitzer Prize winner Richard Ben Cramer ultimately puts to rest the "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?" question with iconoclastic bravura. In Cramer's evaluation, the hero America held onto so desperately for so long was really a creation of a nation's communal imagination. The Joe DiMaggio that America tried so hard to believe in was never really here at all.<p> There was, of course, a Joe DiMaggio, and he had a splendid career in Yankee pinstripes--once hitting safely in an unimaginable 56 consecutive games--and a troubled marriage with Marilyn Monroe, each augmenting the other in our national mythology. But myths tend to be skin-deep, and Cramer's biography thrives in an internal geography well below the surface. The map he charts is of a cold, small, often nasty, uncaring, resentful, self-centered man, a man of public grace and private misery who broke friendships, shunned family, and chased money with the same focused energies he once harnessed to run down fly balls. It's not a pretty picture. </p><p> Scrupulously researched and elegantly written, <i>The Hero's Life</i> is filled with stories and reminiscences, both on and off the field, from others--not surprisingly, DiMaggio offered no cooperation--that both illumine the man and, more fascinatingly, explain our very need for him. Amid all the success and adulation, there was little joy in DiMaggio's life, and few moments--beyond the real heartache he felt over Monroe--of connection with others beyond Joe's personal need for others to serve him. "No one really knew what it meant to have spent a half-century being precisely and distinctly DiMaggio," Cramer writes, "what we required Joe DiMaggio to be. No one knew, as he did, what it cost to live the hero's life. And no one knew, as he did, precisely what it was worth." It seems our nation turned its lonely eyes to a proud, but empty shell; Cramer's superb book helps us understand why we did, and how DiMaggio was able to take all the good will extended him and give so little back. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><b>Richard Ben Cramer</b> won the Pulitzer Prize for Middle East reporting in 1979.

In <i>Strangers Drowning</i>, Larissa MacFarquhar seeks out people living lives of extreme ethical commitment and tells their deeply intimate stories; their stubborn integrity and their compromises; their bravery and their recklessness; their joys and defeats and wrenching dilemmas.<br><br> A couple adopts two children in distress. But then they think: If they can change two lives, why not four? Or ten? They adopt twenty. But how do they weigh the needs of unknown children in distress against the needs of the children they already have?<br> &nbsp;<br> Another couple founds a leprosy colony in the wilderness in India, living in huts with no walls, knowing that their two small children may contract leprosy or be eaten by panthers. The children survive. But what if they hadn&#x2019;t?

She lives on a fraction of her income, but wonders: when is compromise self-indulgence and when is it essential?<br><br> We honor such generosity and high ideals; but when we call people do-gooders there is skepticism in it, even hostility. Why do moral people make us uneasy? Between her stories, MacFarquhar threads a lively history of the literature, philosophy, social science, and self-help that have contributed to a deep suspicion of do-gooders in Western culture.<br><br> Through its sympathetic and beautifully vivid storytelling, <i>Strangers Drowning</i> confronts us with fundamental questions about what it means to be human. In a world of strangers drowning in need, how much should we help, and how much can we help? Is it right to care for strangers even at the expense of those we are closest to? Moving and provocative, <i>Strangers Drowning</i> challenges us to think about what we value most, and why.</p></p><p>LARISSA MACFARQUHAR has been a staff writer at <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1998.

Previously she was a senior editor at <i>Lingua Franca</i> and an advisory editor at <i>The Paris Review</i>. MacFarquhar lives in New York.&#x201c;[Strangers Drowning] really made me think about morality, doing good, the lengths some humans are capable of in terms of altruism, and my own limitations. This is such a thoughtful, philosophical book that doesn't beat you over the head with a message because the message is: Here are people, these are their stories, make of it what you can, but don't dare mock or demonize them. We are human because we are different and have different capabilities.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;Sarah Weinman, Publishers Lunch Favorite Books of 2015&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;I can imagine Larissa MacFarquhar&#x2019;s &#x2018;Strangers Drowning&#x2019; being as wonderful to read a hundred years from now as it was this year. The book reports on extreme &#x2018;do-gooders&#x2019;&#x2014;a favorite chapter looks at a couple who adopted 22 children&#x2014;but its detail-oriented and nonjudgmental intelligence makes it at once morally complex and mythic, modern and timeless.&#x201d;&#x2014; Rivka Galchen<i>, The New York Times Book Review </i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...The keys to the book&#x2019;s success are MacFarquhar&#x2019;s exhaustive journalistic approach and her clear, concise writing...<i>Strangers Drowning</i> is a brilliant jumping-off point to explore where each of us stands morally.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b><br><br>&#x201c;MacFarquhar describes [the altruists&#x2019;] motivations in elegant, empathetic terms...The stories resound with the universality of fables, events unfold at their own pace, and the overall tone of&nbsp;<i>Strangers Drowning,&nbsp;</i>with its panoramic view of actions and their consequences, seems to draw from the texts of psychology, philosophy, and religion in equal measure, evoking the case study, the thought experiment, and the parable.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Bookforum&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;Engaging...MacFarquhar...writes full and nuanced profiles, often by letting her subjects speak for themselves.

The bibliography attests to the fact that she has immersed herself in the relevant literature but her reading is so subterranean that you hardly notice.&nbsp;Strangers Drowning&nbsp;is a book written in a deceptively simple and clear voice about&nbsp;people, about how morality lodges itself in a person not as an abstract idea, or even a value, but as a direction for life...MacFarquhar forgoes the knowing detachment of the interviewer and stays close to her subjects, narrating their lives in her own voice but in what seems to be as faithful a mode as possible...Its ultimate effect is impressive and, one senses, a matter of principle.

You sense a great deal of sifting below the surface of Ms. MacFarquhar&#x2019;s sentences, a reserve of power and intellect drawn upon at will. If her book does not provoke and unsettle you, you may not have a pulse.&#x201d;&#x2014;Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i><br>&#x201c;Thought-provoking...Such ethical urgency, with its aura of perfectionist virtue and saintly sanctimony, stirs ambivalence in most of us. If MacFarquhar thought she might overcome it, she&#x2019;s too honest to pretend she did. These do-gooders aren&#x2019;t moral models. But her discomfiting portraits deliver a humanizing surprise: Few of these altruistic souls nurse any illusion that they are exemplars.&#x201d;<i>&#x2014;The Atlantic&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;In a series of sensitive case studies, acclaimed journalist MacFarquhar examines lives of the full-time do-gooders who give it their all and then some...MacFarquhar&#x2019;s book is a careful meditation on what it means to fully commit to moral&nbsp;living&#x2014;and whether the all-out commitments of this kind are, in the grand scheme of things, worth it.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Magazine <br></i><br> &#x201c;Gripping...The aim of the book is neither to urge readers to change their lives nor to suggest that do-gooders&nbsp;are deluded.

Jeremy Tambling&#39;s provocative Introduction reveals subtle themes relevant today in Dickens&#39; favorite work. 39 illustrations.</p><p>Please note that this is an MP3-CD. This is also available on cassette.<p> In a preface to this novel, Dickens described David Copperfield as his &#x201c;favorite child,&#x201d; and the story has remained among the favorites of Dickens&#x2019; readers, too, with the characters of Betsy Trotwood, Mr. Pegotty, Uriah Heep, and Wilkins Micawber as well as David himself becoming part of the fabric of Western culture. This facsimile reprint is of the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em>, published in the 1870s; the edition makes the work available again in a form in which tens of thousands of Victorians read it&#x2015;in two-column format, interspersed with illustrations throughout. </p> <p> <em>David Copperfield</em> was originally published in nineteen monthly parts between May 1, 1849 and November 1, 1850.* Each part except the last was of roughly the same length; the final installment was approximately twice as long as the others (and sold for 2 shillings, twice the price of previous parts). For the original serial publication, as well as early publication in book form, <em>David Copperfield</em> was illustrated by Hablot Browne (more commonly known as &#x201c;Phiz&#x201d;). </p> <p> Shortly after Dickens&#x2019; death in 1870 the British publisher Chapman &amp; Hall began to issue the <em>Household Edition of the Works of Charles Dickens</em> (not to be confused with the American <em>Household Edition of the Works</em>, which appeared in the 1860s). The principal illustrator for the edition was Fred Barnard, and the Dalziel brothers (the leading wood-engravers of the time) created the engravings from Barnard&#x2019;s illustrations; they described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;by far the most important commission ever placed in our hands by Messrs. Chapman &amp; Hall.&#x201d; Volumes in <em>The Household Edition</em> began to appear in 1871, and the series was completed in 1879. Dickens&#x2019; works appeared in a great many Victorian editions (including numerous pirated ones). Scholars have understandably paid most attention to the earliest publication in serial form; <em>The Household Edition</em> may well have been the most popular form in which the novel appeared, however; the plates for <em>The Household Edition</em> were widely used for other editions as well, and it is certainly arguable that more Victorian readers would have read Dickens&#x2019; novels in this form than in any other. In 1911 the populist bibliophile J.A. Hammerton described <em>The Household Edition</em> as &#x201c;the most important illustrated edition&#x201d; of Dickens&#x2019; works. </p> <p> This is one of a series from Broadview Press of facsimile editions&#x2015;editions that provide readers with a direct sense of these works as the Victorians themselves experienced them. </p> <p> The breaks were as follows: I &#x2013; May 1849 (chs. 1&#x2013;3); II &#x2013; June 1849 (chs. 4&#x2013;6); III &#x2013; July 1849 (chs. 7&#x2013;9); IV &#x2013; August 1849 (chs. 10&#x2013;12); V &#x2013; September 1849 (chs. 13&#x2013;15); VI &#x2013; October 1849 (chs. 16&#x2013;18); VII &#x2013; November 1849 (chs. 19&#x2013;21); VIII &#x2013; December 1849 (chs. 22&#x2013;24); IX &#x2013; January 1850 (chs. 25&#x2013;27); X &#x2013; February 1850 (chs. 28&#x2013;31); XI &#x2013; March 1850 (chs. 32&#x2013;34); XII &#x2013; April 1850 (chs. 35&#x2013;37); XIII &#x2013; May 1850 (chs. 38&#x2013;40); XIV &#x2013; June 1850 (chs. 41&#x2013;43); XV &#x2013; July 1850 (chs. 44&#x2013;46); XVI &#x2013; August 1850 (chs. 47&#x2013;50); XVII &#x2013; September 1850 (chs. 51&#x2013;53); XVIII &#x2013; October 1850 (chs. 54&#x2013;57); XIX-XX &#x2013; November 1850 (chs. 58&#x2013;64). </p></p><h2>Lose Weight with Your Instant Pot: 60 Easy One-Pot Recipes for Fast Weight Loss (Lose Weight By Eating)</h2><p><p>Everyone loves how the Instant Pot is revolutionizing cooking with easy one-pot meals.

Even in the midst of current challenges, America&#x2019;s past is present in all aspects of the contemporary political system. Jillson uses political development and the dynamics of change as a thematic tool to help students understand how politics works now&#x2015;and how institutions, participation, and policies have evolved over time to produce the contemporary political environment. In addition, Jillson helps students think critically about how American democracy might evolve further, focusing in every chapter on reform and further change. </p> <p></p><b> <p>New to the 10th Edition</p> </b><ul><b></b> <p> </p><li>Assesses the characteristics and early results of the Trump administration.</li> <li>Covers the 2018 midterm elections and looks ahead to the 2020 presidential race.</li> <li>Explores the political and judicial fights over ballot integrity and gerrymandering.</li> <li>Examines challenges to civil liberties in the wake of Charlottesville, the Muslim ban, and NSA warrantless surveillance. </li> <li>Discusses the MeToo movement in the context of civil rights.</li> <li>Includes important Supreme Court events and decisions including the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch.</li> <li>Presents new material on race, ethnicity, gender, and political participation, especially in the context of social media.</li> <li>Details Republican tax cuts and their likely impact on deficits and debt.</li> <li>Discusses the Trump administration&#x2019;s climate change strategy and the December 2017 National Security Strategy of the United States, looking ahead to security challenges in Korea and the Middle East.</li> <li>Updates all data in tables and figures through the 2018 midterms.</li> <p></p></ul> <p></p><b> <p>Features</p></b> <p>In a streamlined presentation, Jillson delivers a concise and engaging narrative to help students understand the complexities and importance of American politics.

It does a very good job of offering students a sense of why we do things one way rather than another in historical terms. I think the author&#x2019;s clear writing is one of the text&#x2019;s most attractive features. </p> <p><strong>Thomas Hoffman</strong>, <em>Spring Hill College</em> </p> <p>The coverage of social movements is especially unique&#x2015;most texts I&#x2019;ve read do not go this far in-depth into the history and tactics of social movements, so important at this time. Also, I&#x2019;ve found that students often have difficulty remembering court cases. Throughout the text, the author offers additional narrative to court cases that makes them more human and memorable. By providing the stories behind these cases, students are better able to remember them and see their importance in American politics. The same is true of the &#x201c;Constitution Today&#x201d; feature&#x2015;a nice way to highlight how history shapes our reality now. Too often, students see the Constitution and Founding as trivia, with little connection to how we continue to struggle with the same controversies today. It&#x2019;s nice that this feature is revisited in each chapter to drive home the point that the debates surrounding the Constitution over 200 years ago are still important today. </p> <p><strong>Lauren R. Elliott-Dorans</strong>, <em>Ohio University</em> </p> <p><strong>PRAISE FOR PREVIOUS EDITIONS</strong> </p> <p>This terrific textbook will help students get to the bottom of the mysteries of the American government and why it has been so difficult for Americans to work together for the common good. Cal Jillson expertly shows us how our past shapes our current political path, from Black Lives Matter to the legalization of marijuana, voter ID, mass shootings, and the historic election of 2016. </p> <p><strong>David B. Robertson</strong>, <em>University of Missouri-St. Louis</em> </p> <p>Most of my students are non-majors. They walk into the course expecting to be bored. Jillson&#x2019;s text helps them get over that. I've considered many textbooks over the years and this is clearly the right one for me. </p> <p><strong>Keith Dougherty</strong>, <em>University of Georgia</em> </p> <p>Clear, comprehensive, and concise, this is no doubt the best American government text on the market today. </p> <p><strong>Christopher Malone</strong>, <em>Pace University</em> </p> <p>This book truly stands apart from the vast crowd of introductory American politics textbooks. </p> <p><strong>Shamira M. Gelbman</strong>, <em>Illinois State University</em></p> <p>A book that connects the political challenges of today to the political conflicts of the past. </p> <p><strong>Jonathan Chausovsky</strong>, <em>SUNY Fredonia</em> </p> <p>The ideals that Jillson so thoroughly includes in this text are straight down the middle and do not in any way cater to the right or left, which is a refreshing idea in today&#x2019;s educational world.

Each individual now lives in isolation below ground in a standard room, with all bodily and spiritual needs met by the omnipotent, global Machine. Travel is permitted, but is unpopular and rarely necessary. Communication is made via a kind of instant messaging/video conferencing machine with which people conduct their only activity: the sharing of ideas and what passes for knowledge.&nbsp; It is intended as a chilling reminder of the possible consequences on over reliance on machines and the changes to human capacity and character that could result from this over dependence.&nbsp; Consider a classic of the science fiction genre and a prescient warning about our reliance on machine technology.</p></p><p>Edward Morgan Forster, OM (January 1, 1879 &#x2013; June 7, 1970), was an English novelist, short story writer, and essayist. He is known best for his ironic and well-plotted novels examining class difference and hypocrisy in early 20th-century British society. Forster's humanistic impulse toward understanding and sympathy may be aptly summed up in the epigraph to his 1910 novel Howards End: "Only connect." Forster was gay, but this fact was not made public during his lifetime. His posthumously released novel Maurice tells of the coming of age of an explicitly gay male character.</p><h2>Understanding Biblical Theology: A Comparison of Theory and Practice</h2><p><p><em>Understanding Biblical Theology</em> clarifies the catch-all term &#x201c;biblical theology,&#x201d; a movement that tries to remove the often-held dichotomy between biblical studies for the Church and as an academic pursuit.</p><p>This book examines the five major schools of thought regarding biblical theology and handles each in turn, defining and giving a brief developmental history for each one, and exploring each method through the lens of one contemporary scholar who champions it. Using a spectrum between history and theology, each of five &#x201c;types&#x201d; of biblical theology are identified as either &#x201c;more theological&#x201d; or &#x201c;more historical&#x201d; in concern and practice:</p><ul><li>Biblical Theology as Historical Description (James Barr)<strong></strong></li><li>Biblical Theology as History of Redemption (D. A. Carson)<strong></strong></li><li>Biblical Theology as Worldview-Story (N. T. Wright)<strong></strong></li><li>Biblical Theology as Canonical Approach (Brevard Childs)<strong></strong></li><li>Biblical Theology as Theological Construction (Francis Watson). <strong></strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;A conclusion suggests how any student of the Bible can learn from these approaches.</p></p><p><p>Edward W.

Along with Tom Shales, he is the author of the #1 bestseller <i>Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN.</i><br><br>Tom Shales is America's foremost television critic, having won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1988. For twenty-five years, he was film critic for National Public Radio.John Belushi! Dan Akroyd! Steve Martin! Chris Farley! The Church Lady . . . Pat . . . Rosanne Rosannadanna . . . The Killer Bees. And dozens of other celebrities, sketches, and cast . . . do not appear on this program except in disembodied form as a platoon of experienced readers slog through this tell-all history of SNL. That's the main weakness of this set. Though we learn in detail the peccadilloes of the long history of the show, no original cast members and not one minute of show outtakes grace the hours and hours of talk. This would be a fantastic journey if only the publisher had shelled out the licensing fees and reimbursed the stars. You know when a potentially great listen gets so boring that your brain gets numb? Yeah, I hate it when that happens!

In passing the<br>No Child Left Behind law, Congress and the president made a promise to<br>our children that all will have an equal opportunity to get a high-quality<br>education and master high academic standards. That means <i>all</i> our children no matter what language they speak, how much their families earn,<br>what disabilities they may have, what God they worship (if any), or what<br>holidays they celebrate.<br> <br>Quality public education may be national and state policy, but it is not<br>yet a civil right. There remain tremendous disparities in funding, facilities,<br>and instructional resources across our sixteen thousand school districts,<br>and this inequity underlies the poor outcomes that the law attempts<br>to address. Consequently, our public schools need all the help they can<br>get from parents, family members, community residents, local organizations,<br>and anyone else whom we can engage in children&#x2019;s learning.<br>Demands for reform continue to mount. Federal and state action has<br>produced a strong move toward higher standards of achievement, increased<br>testing, and accountability to the public for results. There is considerable<br>backlash, however, especially against using high-stakes standardized tests<br>to hold schools liable for poor performance and to prevent students with<br>low scores from graduating.<br> <br>While some see progress, many corporate and foundation leaders are<br>impatient with the pace of change. Educators and policy makers are arguing<br>over whether funding is adequate to meet all the new federal mandates.<br>Public support appears to be growing for vouchers and competition<br>from the private sector as the main tools for reform. We think that parents<br>and community members, working as partners with educators, can accomplish<br>change within the public sector but this will take a new model of<br>working together, one that goes way beyond the bake sale.<br>There are five reasons why you should read this book.<br> <br> <b>1. Partnership and student academic achievement are<br>closely linked.</b> Many years of research show that involving families<br>and the community contributes to children&#x2019;s academic and social<br>success.<br> <br>The evidence is consistent, positive, and convincing: families have<br>a major influence on their children&#x2019;s achievement. When schools,<br>families, and community groups work together to support learning,<br>children tend to do better in school, stay in school longer, and like<br>school more.<br> <br>This statement summarizes the conclusion of <i>A New Wave of Evidence:<br>The Impact of School, Family and Community Connections on Student<br>Achievement</i>, the most recent and comprehensive review of the research.<br>Here are some key findings:<br> <br>Students whose families are involved in their learning earn better<br>grades, enroll in higher-level programs, have higher graduation<br>rates, and are more likely to enroll in post-secondary<br>education.<br>When families take an active interest in what they&#x2019;re learning,<br>students display more positive attitudes toward school and<br>behave better both in and out of school.<br>Children do best if parents can play a variety of roles in their<br>learning: helping at home, volunteering at school, planning<br>their children&#x2019;s future, and taking part in key decisions about<br>the school program.<br>Middle and high school students whose families remain involved<br>in these ways make better transitions, maintain the quality of<br>their work, develop realistic plans for the future, and are less<br>likely to drop out.<br>Children from diverse cultural backgrounds tend to do better<br>when families and school staff join forces to bridge the gap<br>between home and school cultures.<br> <br>From early childhood through high school, families make key contributions<br>to student learning. School improvement programs are much more<br>effective when schools enlist families in the process. Regardless of income<br>level or education background, all families can and do support their<br>children&#x2019;s success.<br> <br>When parents become involved at school, they tend to become more<br>active in the community. Well-planned family learning and support activities<br>tend to increase self-confidence, so parents and family members go<br>on to pursue a high school diploma, additional job training, and higher<br>education. Knowledge is power. Well-informed parents can be more effective<br>and productive partners.<br> <br>The more the relationship between families and the school is a real<br>partnership, the more student achievement increases. When schools<br>engage families in ways that are linked to improving learning, students<br>make greater gains. When families are engaged in positive ways, rather<br>than labeled as problems, schools can be transformed from places where<br>only certain students prosper to ones where all children do well.<br> <br>Community groups make important contributions, too. One key difference<br>between high- and low-achieving children is how (and with whom)<br>they spend their time outside school. Community groups offer important<br>resources for students and families, and schools can provide a critical link<br>to these resources.<br> <br>Be warned: positive results are not automatic. They are more likely to<br>be achieved when school, family, and community partnership programs<br>are well planned and carefully executed. How to do this is what this book<br>is all about.<br> <br> <b>2. Partnerships help build and sustain public support for<br>the schools.</b> In this era of market-driven education reforms, including<br>vouchers and charter schools, public schools are seeking increased support.<br>The traditional approach is public relations. We think that three<br>other partnership strategies offer more direct benefits, both to schools and<br>to the community:<br> <br> <ol>1.Conducting active programs to engage the public, including<br>parents and families<br>2. Working with community organizations to help students and<br>families and to improve educational quality<br>3. Promoting greater citizen participation in our democracy</ol> <br> <br>Schools that embrace the partnership idea in practice enjoy higher levels<br>of respect and trust in the community, as well as among school staff<br>and families. Partnership schools tend to have better teacher morale and<br>higher ratings of teachers by families. They also have more support from<br>families, better reputations in the community, and more success at implementing<br>school reform initiatives.<br> <br>Collaborative approaches can contribute to strengthening the human,<br>social, and economic foundation of neighborhoods. One goal of school community<br>initiatives is to develop a neighborhood&#x2019;s ability to identify<br>its own issues and marshal sufficient resources to solve problems. This<br>kind of community capacity can help not only to improve the safety and<br>economic vitality of neighborhoods but also, as it evolves, to improve the<br>quality of teaching and learning in the schools.<br> <br>Community agencies and institutions benefit, too. When they collaborate<br>with schools, they can reach more easily the people they want<br>to serve and gain access to school services and expertise. In the process,<br>they can increase public support for their work and even save money by<br>eliminating overlapping services.<br> <br>Families are more stable and healthy if they can meet basic needs for<br>housing, food, transportation, and employment. When schools team up<br>with community organizations, families can gain access to a range of<br>social services. Then they are in a better position to take advantage of<br>other opportunities, such as counseling, additional education, and job<br>training. Many studies have documented the resulting benefits for families<br>and children, including:<br> <br>Increased knowledge of child development<br>Greater confidence in their role as their child&#x2019;s first teacher<br>More frequent attendance at school meetings and a stronger<br>sense of responsibility for children&#x2019;s schooling<br>Improved literacy and other skills<br>Better communication with schools and teachers<br> <br> <b>3. Families and the community can help schools overcome<br>the challenges they face.</b> The challenges for America&#x2019;s public<br>schools are great and growing, and many schools are making heroic efforts<br>to address them. Serious gaps in achievement persist between more affluent<br>children and those from low-income families. New waves of immigration<br>from Central America, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East are bringing<br>to many schools more children and families whose English is limited and<br>who are not familiar with our school system or society.<br> <br>During the 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million people entered the<br>country, far more than in any decade in the nation&#x2019;s history. This pace was<br>sustained during 2000 2004, with the foreign-born population increasing<br>by over 1 million per year. By 2000, immigrants represented one in nine of<br>all U.S. residents, and their children represented one in five of all children<br>under eighteen. While these children are at first concentrated in the great<br>gateway cities, they are rapidly dispersing across the country.<br> <br>As poverty rates rise and manufacturing jobs decline, families and<br>communities face multiple economic and social problems. These have a<br>direct impact on the schools. For example, the number of highly mobile<br>families has increased. Of the more than 290 million people in the<br>United States, 43 million move each year. In many communities, the<br>shortage of affordable housing has put numerous families on the street.<br>Homelessness affects children&#x2019;s health, their mental stability, and their<br>work in school.<br> <br>The findings of a new, rigorous study on the actual dropout rate between<br>ninth and twelfth grades are summed up in its title: <i>Losing Our Future:<br>How Minority Youth Are Being Left Behind by the Graduation Rate Crisis</i>. In<br>predominantly black and Latino urban districts, high school graduation<br>rates are well under 50 percent. Where do the students who drop out go?<br>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, about half of<br>prison inmates are dropouts, and a high proportion of these have been in<br>special education programs.<br> <br>Changing family patterns also present schools with challenges. For<br>example, the 2000 Census shows that over 4 million children are living<br>with grandparents, and that one-fourth of these grandparents have sole<br>responsibility for the children. Nearly half of low-income children, those<br>in the bottom 20 percent, live with only one parent, and nearly half move<br>every year.<br> <br>These changes in society and the economy have spawned what the<br>media call the culture wars.&#x201d; Many communities are beset with sharp<br>debates about religious expression in schools (including prayer, religious<br>clubs, and how to teach evolution); appropriate treatment of gay, lesbian,<br>and transgendered students; and how to prevent bullying and sexual<br>harassment. School staff are coping with changes in traditional sexual<br>roles and values, and with cultural differences in food, dress, and music.<br>Language differences trigger debates on whether instruction for Englishlanguage<br>learners should be given in the home language or focus strictly<br>on English. Safety in and around schools is another pervasive challenge,<br>intensified by headline-grabbing incidents of violence.<br> <br>There is wide disagreement about solutions to these controversies.<br>School leaders are in the uncomfortable position of having to mediate<br>the disputes and build a consensus about what to do. They know that<br>schools can address few, if any, of these challenges effectively by themselves.<br>Principals, teachers, and other staff already work long hours and<br>volunteer time during vacations to work with families and coordinate programs.<br>Common sense and years of experience suggest that a collaborative<br>approach is needed to define the problems, discuss productive approaches,<br>and design and implement possible solutions. Ideas and examples for how<br>to do this are presented throughout this book.<br> <br> <b>4. Teachers can benefit from parent and community<br>partnerships.</b> Teachers say they want more support from parents and<br>are troubled by what they see as low parent involvement and poor student<br>behavior. Yet they are unsure about how to collaborate productively with<br>families. Many tend to be more comfortable with helping families to be<br>involved with their children at home than with engaging families in their<br>classrooms and school buildings.<br> <br>School leaders can help teachers and their unions understand how partnership<br>approaches can be of direct benefit to them. Plans for partnerships<br>are often developed with little or no teacher input, and teachers are told,<br> Just do it.&#x201d; A top-down, management-driven approach confirms many<br>teachers&#x2019; perception that their views are often ignored. This can doom the<br>effort from the start. If, instead, teachers are involved in planning at the<br>outset, they can become powerful allies for expanding the connections<br>among schools, parents, and community members.<br> <br>In addition, educators can learn a great deal from parents. Parents and other<br>family members bring knowledge and perspectives about their children, their<br>culture and values, and the strengths and problems of their communities.<br> <br> <b>5. The No Child Left Behind Act provides partnership<br>opportunities that can help schools meet the requirements of<br>the law.</b> No Child Left Behind (NCLB) holds public schools accountable<br>to provide all students with a quality education, putting educators<br>under intense pressure. School officials who ignore the requirements of<br>this federal program are at considerable financial risk.<br> <br>For example, families in a Title I school (Title I of NCLB provides<br>funding to schools serving concentrations of low-income children) may<br>transfer their children to a higher-performing school if the current school<br>does not make adequate yearly progress&#x201d; for two years in a row. Students<br>who do not transfer must be offered supplemental services, such as after-school<br>tutoring or classes in reading and math, paid for by the school<br>district.<br> <br>It is wise to pay careful attention to the law&#x2019;s obligations and opportunities<br>for parent involvement, for they can offer resources to make that<br>adequate yearly progress.<br></p><h2>Haunted: On Ghosts, Witches, Vampires, Zombies, and Other Monsters of the Natural and Supernatural Worlds</h2><p><b>An award-winning scholar and author charts four hundred years of monsters and how they reflect the culture that created them</b><br><br> Leo Braudy, a finalist for both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award, has won accolades for revealing the complex and constantly shifting history behind seemingly unchanging ideas of fame, war, and masculinity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Continuing his interest in the history of emotion, this book explores how fear has been shaped into images of monsters and monstrosity. From the Protestant Reformation to contemporary horror films and fiction, he explores four major types: the monster from nature (King Kong), the created monster (Frankenstein), the monster from within (Mr. Hyde), and the monster from the past (Dracula). Drawing upon deep historical and literary research, Braudy discusses the lasting presence of fearful imaginings in an age of scientific progress, viewing the detective genre as a rational riposte to the irrational world of the monstrous. <i>Haunted</i> is a compelling and incisive work by a writer at the height of his powers.</p><p><b>Leo Braudy</b> is University Professor and Bing Chair in English and American Literature at the University of Southern California.

While beginning birdwatchers prefer photographic guides like those by Donald Stokes, the physical traits that make identification easier are more readily discerned in the idealized paintings of illustrative guides like those by Roger Tory Peterson and National Geographic. Kaufman's groundbreaking work combines the best of both approaches by digitally enhancing photographic images to show the characteristics that are sometimes not apparent in photographs. <p> Some other distinguishing features include: </p><ul> <li>The guide is organized by bird family groupings rather than strict taxonomic classification; this is a feature that will appeal especially to beginners. </li><li>Text descriptions and range maps for each species appear on the page facing the plate of respective bird images. </li><li>Important field marks are highlighted. </li><li>Color-coded tabs identify each grouping of birds (waders, warblers, sparrows, etc.) for quick thumb indexing. </li></ul> Kaufman's efforts follow the auspicious tradition of Roger Tory Peterson, whose portable field guide system was the first of its kind to meet the needs of the average birdwatcher. "It's the guide I've always wanted," says Kaufman, "and I suspect most birders will feel the same way."Kenn Kaufman is a legend among birders. At sixteen he hitchhiked back and forth across North America, traveling eighty thousand miles in a year, simply to see as many birds as he could; he came back to tell the story in KINGBIRD HIGHWAY. A field editor for AUDUBON and a regular contributor to every major birding magazine, he is the youngest person ever to receive the Ludlow Griscom Award, the highest honor of the American Birding Association. His natural history pursuits have taken him to all seven continents, but he has made a special study of North American birds.

S. Lewis after his conversion, <em>The Pilgrim's Regress</em> is, in a sense, the record of Lewis's own search for meaning and spiritual satisfaction -- a search that eventually led him to Christianity.<br><br>Here is the story of the pilgrim John and his odyssey to an enchanting island which has created in him an intense longing 7mdash; a mysterious, sweet desire. John's pursuit of this desire takes him through adventures with such people as Mr. Enlightenment, Media Halfways, Mr. Mammon, Mother Kirk, Mr. Sensible, and Mr. Humanist and through such cities as Thrill and Eschropolis as well as the Valley of Humiliation.<br><br>Though the dragons and giants here are different from those in Bunyan's <em>Pilgrim's Progress</em>, Lewis's allegory performs the same function of enabling the author to say simply and through fantasy what would otherwise have demanded a full-length philosophy of religion.</p><p>(1898-1963) He held the chair of Medieval and Renaissance English Literature at Cambridge University in England. Among his many famous works are <em>Mere Christianity</em>, <em>The Screwtape Letters</em>, the <em>Chronicles of Narnia</em> series, <em>Miracles</em>, <em>The Abolition of Man</em>, <em>The Great Divorce</em>, <em>The Problem of Pain</em>, and <em>Surprised by Joy</em>.In 1933, not long after he became a Christian, Lewis published this third work and his first novel, a portrayal of this spiritual journey. Begun as a poem, Pilgrim's Regress thankfully ended up as an allegory that obviously takes its cue from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Every bit as effective as its predecessor, Lewis's book describes the quest of John to reach the enchanted island and describes and satirizes many of the popular philosophies of the author's time, many of which also have more than a little influence in our day. Eloquent, erudite, and often witty, this tale is superbly narrated by Robert Whitfield. No stranger to the writings of Lewis, Whitfield has a well-modulated voice that easily portrays the numerous characters and gives the narrative sections a steady and consistent tempo. There are a number of Latin epigraphs, which are not translated. Public, religious/theological, and academic libraries should at least consider this audio. Michael T.

This format will delight both those who know the great dramatist&#39;s works and those who are new to them. Michael Foreman&#39;s dramatic color illustrations and varied black-and-white line drawings are the perfect complement to this celebration of Shakespeare&#39;s genius.</p><p>MICHAEL FOREMAN is one of the world&#39;s leading illustrators of children&#39;s books and the winner of several major awards, including the Kate Greenaway Medal. His work ranges from picture books to fairy tales and original children&#39;s fiction. He is the illustrator of many Harcourt books, including Michael Foreman&#39;s Mother Goose, Joan of Arc, and Arthur, High King of Britain. He divides his time between London and St. Ives, England, his childhood home.Grade 5 Up The value of this book will depend upon the intended use. From the deep orange endpapers, through generous margins and clear print, to the multitude of evocative illustrations, the volume is a delight. Foreman's intense watercolors and lively ink-wash illustrations go far to help create the moods of the stories. The storytelling is unevenGarfield is able to evoke the heartbreak of King Lear but fails to convey the crazy humor of Twelfth Night but it is generally competent enough. However, Garfield's visual descriptions are so specific and so lavish; his line interpretations so absolute that he almost guarantees that any given production will seem inadequate after such a buildup! Libraries that have Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare (Macmillan, 1963; o.p.) or Chute's Stories from Shakespeare (World, 1956; o.p.) probably don't need to add this luxury item. Garfield covers only 12 of the best-known plays, while the Lambs tell 20 tales and Chute leads the pack with 36.

With the addition of a section on modern, synthetic rope in the 1970s, its popularity has continued undiminished to this day. It teaches a few basic knots--the bowline, sheet bend, and rolling hitch, among others--and splices in three-strand and braided rope. But its real business is decorative rope and canvaswork--the traditional arts of the sailor--and here it has no equal.

In <i>More Than Night</i>, James Naremore discusses these pictures, but he also shows that the central term is more complex and paradoxical than we realize. Film noir refers both to an important cinematic legacy and to an idea we have projected onto the past.<br><br>This lively, wide-ranging cultural history offers an original approach to the subject, as well as new production information and fresh commentary on scores of films, including such classics as <i>Double Indemnity</i>, <i>The Third Man</i>, and <i>Out of the Past</i>, and such "neo noirs" as <i>Chinatown</i>, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, and <i>Devil in a Blue Dress</i>. Naremore discusses film noir as a term in criticism; as an expression of artistic modernism; as a symptom of Hollywood censorship and politics in the 1940s; as a market strategy; as an evolving style; as a cinema about races and nationalities; and as an idea that circulates across all the information technologies. Interdisciplinary in approach, this book has valuable things to say not only about film and television, but also about modern literature, the fine arts, and popular culture in general. In a field where much of what has been published is superficial and derivative, Naremore's work is certain to be received as a definitive treatment.</p><p>&#34;One of the very best film books in recent years. . . . There are any number of books on noir, but none as comprehensive, as rigorous, as far- reaching as Naremore&#39;s. . . .

Through a careful evaluation of the New Testament (and other surviving sources, including the more recently discovered Gospels of Thomas and Peter), Ehrman proposes that Jesus can be best understood as an apocalyptic prophet--a man convinced that the world would end dramatically within the lifetime of his apostles and that a new kingdom would be created on earth. According to Ehrman, Jesus' belief in a coming apocalypse and his expectation of an utter reversal in the world's social organization not only underscores the radicalism of his teachings but also sheds light on both the appeal of his message to society's outcasts and the threat he posed to Jerusalem's established leadership.<br></p><p>C.S. Lewis once noted that nowhere do the Gospels say, "Jesus laughed." He's probably laughing now, if he's got access to Bart Ehrman's <i>Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium</i>. The title doesn't even hint at the yuks that Ehrman's prose delivers, but from its very first page, <i>Jesus</i> will tickle your funny bone and stimulate your brain. "At last count," Ehrman begins, "there were something like 8 zillion books written about Jesus .... It's not there aren't <i>enough</i> books about Jesus out there. It's that there aren't enough of the right <i>kind</i> of book. Very, very few, in fact. I'd say about one and a half." <p> The right <i>kind</i> of book, according to Ehrman, is one that portrays Jesus roughly as Albert Schweitzer did, as a first-century Jewish apocalypticist: "This is a shorthand way of saying that Jesus fully expected that the history of the world as we know it (well, as he knew it) was going to come to a screeching halt, that God was soon going to intervene in the affairs of this world, overthrow the forces of evil in a cosmic act of judgment, destroy huge masses of humanity, and abolish existing human political and religious institutions. All this would be a prelude to the arrival of a new order on earth, the Kingdom of God." Ehrman's is a historical-Jesus book, a very smart, humble, and humorous popular summary of Christian and secular evidence of Jesus' life, work, and legacy. He believes that apocalypticism is the true core of Jesus' message, and that comfortable middle-class complacency among scholars, clergy, and laypeople has forged a counterfeit, domesticated, "ethical" Jesus to cover up their befuddlement about his misprediction of the apocalypse. The book will frustrate many readers because it offers no real guidance regarding what one should <i>do</i> with Jesus' apocalypticism. Its project--to prove that Jesus was wrong about the apocalypse--may even appear destructive to some. Yet the argument is convincing enough to induce among careful readers a constructive experience of confusion. <i>Jesus</i> makes readers ask the very question it appears to ignore, in a newly humble way: how, then, should we live? A serious matter, but considering humanity's endless string of wrong answers and infinite capacity for self-delusion, worthy of some good belly laughs, as well. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><br><strong>Bart D.

Highly educated and defined by cultural capital rather than income bracket, these individuals earnestly buy organic, carry NPR tote bags, and breast-feed their babies. They care about discreet, inconspicuous consumption&#x2015;like eating free-range chicken and heirloom tomatoes, wearing organic cotton shirts and TOMS shoes, and listening to the <i>Serial</i> podcast. They use their purchasing power to hire nannies and housekeepers, to cultivate their children&#x2019;s growth, and to practice yoga and Pilates. In <i>The Sum of Small Things</i>, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett dubs this segment of society &#x201c;the aspirational class&#x201d; and discusses how, through deft decisions about education, health, parenting, and retirement, the aspirational class reproduces wealth and upward mobility, deepening the ever-wider class divide.</p><br><p>Exploring the rise of the aspirational class, Currid-Halkett considers how much has changed since the 1899 publication of Thorstein Veblen&#x2019;s <i>Theory of the Leisure Class</i>. In that inflammatory classic, which coined the phrase &#x201c;conspicuous consumption,&#x201d; Veblen described upper-class frivolities: men who used walking sticks for show, and women who bought silver flatware despite the effectiveness of cheaper aluminum utensils. Now, Currid-Halkett argues, the power of material goods as symbols of social position has diminished due to their accessibility. As a result, the aspirational class has altered its consumer habits away from overt materialism to more subtle expenditures that reveal status and knowledge. And these transformations influence how we all make choices.</p><br><p>With a rich narrative and extensive interviews and research, <i>The Sum of Small Things</i> illustrates how cultural capital leads to lifestyle shifts and what this forecasts, not just for the aspirational class but for everyone.</p></p><p><p>"<i>The Sum of Small Things</i> crackles with original insights about consumer goods and the individuals who choose them. Currid-Halkett's concepts of &#x2018;the aspirational class' and &#x2018;conspicuous production' advance consumption studies and provide fresh news about the search for distinction. Fast-paced, well-told, and unfailingly interesting, this book is an intellectual treat across the board."<b>--Harvey Molotch, author of <i>Against Security</i></b></p><p>"What are the status consumption habits of the twenty-first century? In <i>The Sum of Small Things</i>, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett blends social science and keen observation to present the new, best guide to this topic of never-ending interest, for the status-conscious in all of us."<b>--Tyler Cowen, author of <i>The Complacent Class</i></b></p><p>"'Organic', 'artisanal', 'boutique'--these are the catchwords of what has become, in Elizabeth Currid-Halkett's view, a new self-regarding social class, grounded less in money than in elite education, and inured to the problems of those less fortunate. This is a timely, original, and disquieting analysis of contemporary American society."<b>--Richard A. Easterlin, University of Southern California</b></p><p>"Exploring how the consumer choices of today's &#x2018;aspirational class&#x2019; express identity and values yet reinforce social exclusivity and economic status, Elizabeth Currid-Halkett&#x2019;s lively book offers a thoroughly researched and fair-minded update to Veblen&#x2019;s classic look at the leisure class. Eschewing mockery and polemics, <i>The Sum of Small Things</i> challenges readers to think hard about culture and consumption in a postscarcity economy."<b>--Virginia Postrel, author of <i>The Power of Glamour</i></b></p><p>"Just as Thorstein Veblen captured his time with the phrase &#x2018;conspicuous consumption,' Elizabeth Currid-Halkett nails the contemporary rise of a subtler but no less materialist inconspicuous consumption. This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand modern cities or culture today."<b>--Richard Florida, author of <i>The Rise of the Creative Class</i></b></p><p>"This book takes readers on a tour of contemporary U.S. inequality--in particular the classes who occupy its highest strata&#x2014;via characteristic patterns of consumption behavior.

I was looking at the mountain and it was pure white, absolutely pure, especially the peaks that lie to the west. And I saw the pure beauty of their shape and outline, all in white. And I heard a voice saying-or got the clear idea of: 'There is another side to the mountain.'. . . This morning my quarrel with the mountain is ended . . . why get mad at a mountain? It is beautiful, chastely white in the morning sun-and right in view of the bungalow window."There is another side of Kanchenjunga and of every mountain-the side that has never been photographed and turned into postcards. That is the only side worth seeing" (November 19, 1968).</p><p>The seventh and final volume of Thomas Merton's journals finds him exploring new territory, both spiritual and geographic, in the last great journey prior to his untimely death. Traveling in the United States and the Far East, Merton enjoys a new freedom that brings with it a rich mix of solitude, spirited friendship, and interaction with monks of other traditions.</p><p>In his last days in the United States, Merton continues to follow the tumultuous events closing the 1960s, including the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Robert Kennedy. Meanwhile, with the blessing of his new abbot, Merton travels to monasteries in New Mexico and among the redwoods of Northern California, keeping his journal all the while. In these travels, as well as on a later trip to Alaska, he gains a better understanding of his eremitical yearnings and begins to see a way to reconcile his conflicting desires for solitude and fellowship.</p><p>When Merton wins approval to participate in a meeting of monastic superiors of the Far East in Bangkok, Thailand, his life enters its most thrilling period. Arriving in Calcutta, Merton is heartbroken by the poverty of the many beggars; in New Delhi and Dharamsala, he makes contact with local Buddhists, including the Dalai Lama. Recognizing each other as kindred spirits, Merton and the Dalai Lama speak from the heart like old friends.</p><p>In Bangkok at the beginning of December 1968, awaiting the beginning of the conference, Merton pens a letter home: "I think of you all on this Feast Day and with Christmas approaching I feel homesick for Gethsemani." Tragically, Christmas Day finds Merton back home after all. Electrocuted accidentally in his Bangkok room, Merton is returned to his beloved abbey to be laid to rest in a grave overlooking the woods so familiar to him from his twenty-seven years of monastic life at Gethsemani.</p><p>Thirty years after his death, the contributions of Thomas Merton remain as vital as ever. Completing the published Journals of Thomas Merton, <em>The Other Side of the Mountain</em> conveys the intense spiritual exploration and powerful lessons that filled his short life.</p></p><p><i>The Other Side of the Mountain</i> is the seventh and final volume of Thomas Merton's journals, covering the last two years of his life. In this book, Merton finally makes peace with his ambivalent relationship to the Church: his civil rights and anti-nuclear work, his interest in Eastern spirituality, and his love for Catholic orthodoxy coalesce into a mature voice that avoids the frosty pieties to which he was often partial in his younger years. This volume takes its title from an entry made during his final travels in India and the Far East. In this entry, he relates a dream about gazing at the mountain Kanchenjunga: <blockquote> I heard a voice saying--or got the clear idea of: "There is another side to the mountain." ... There is another side of Kanchenjunga and of every mountain--the side that has never been photographed and turned into postcards. That is the only side worth seeing. </blockquote> The next month, Merton died from accidental electrocution in a hotel room in Bangkok. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Thomas Merton (1915-1968) is widely regarded as one of the most influential spiritual writers of modern times. He was a Trappist monk, writer, and peace and civil rights activist.

In it he describes how various forms of thinking are evoked, developed, and refined through the arts. These forms of thinking, Eisner argues, are more helpful in dealing with the ambiguities and uncertainties of daily life than are the formally structured curricula that are employed today in schools.<br><br>Offering a rich array of examples, Eisner describes different approaches to the teaching of the arts and the virtues each possesses when well taught. He discusses especially nettlesome issues pertaining to the evaluation of performance in the arts. Perhaps most important, Eisner provides a fresh and admittedly iconoclastic perspective on what the arts can contribute to education, namely a new vision of both its aims and its means. This new perspective, Eisner argues, is especially important today, a time at which mechanistic forms of technical rationality often dominate our thinking about the conduct and assessment of education.<br></p><p>&#34;By illuminating the various ways that making and appreciating art are cognitive endeavors, Eisner invites us to celebrate the uniqueness of art education and entices us to explore the rich connections between thinking and learning in the arts and in other areas.&#34; -Shari Tishman, Harvard University<b>Elliot W.

The "Theory of Everything" that appears to be emerging includes everything but us: the feelings, meanings, consciousness, and purposes that make us (and many of our animal cousins) what we are. These most immediate and incontrovertible phenomena are left unexplained by the natural sciences because they lack the physical properties&#x2015;such as mass, momentum, charge, and location&#x2015;that are assumed to be necessary for something to have physical consequences in the world. This is an unacceptable omission. We need a "theory of everything" that does not leave it absurd that we exist.<br><br><em>Incomplete Nature</em> begins by accepting what other theories try to deny: that, although mental contents do indeed lack these material-energetic properties, they are still entirely products of physical processes and have an unprecedented kind of causal power that is unlike anything that physics and chemistry alone have so far explained. Paradoxically, it is the intrinsic incompleteness of these semiotic and teleological phenomena that is the source of their unique form of physical influence in the world. <em>Incomplete Nature</em> meticulously traces the emergence of this special causal capacity from simple thermodynamics to self-organizing dynamics to living and mental dynamics, and it demonstrates how specific absences (or constraints) play the critical causal role in the organization of physical processes that generate these properties.<br><br> The book's radically challenging conclusion is that we are made of these specific absenses&#x2015;such stuff as dreams are made on&#x2015;and that what is not immediately present can be as physically potent as that which is. It offers a figure/background shift that shows how even meanings and values can be understood as legitimate components of the physical world. 12 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>Terrence W.

Michael is raised by Martians, and he arrives on Earth as a true innocent: he has never seen a woman and has no knowledge of Earth's cultures or religions. But he brings turmoil with him, as he is the legal heir to an enormous financial empire, not to mention <i>de facto</i> owner of the planet Mars. With the irascible popular author Jubal Harshaw to protect him, Michael explores human morality and the meanings of love. He founds his own church, preaching free love and disseminating the psychic talents taught him by the Martians. Ultimately, he confronts the fate reserved for all messiahs.<p> The impact of <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i> was considerable, leading many children of the 60's to set up households based on Michael's water-brother nests.

The language and content of the plays is seen as too difficult for younger children but primary children are underestimated as to what they can accomplish given the challenge. The study of Shakespeare has become an integral part of my grade two program at Hamlet School, in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. </p><p> When I first moved to Stratford, I had no intention of teaching Shakespeare to 7 and 8 year olds. Stratford is a beautiful city noted for its Shakespearean theatre and I was interested that the schools were all named after Shakespearean characters. I asked my class, "Who is William Shakespeare?" and "Why is our school called Hamlet?" Their answers were surprising. One thought he was a famous boxer. Another believed he was the President of Canada. A third student responded, "I don't know who William Shakespeare is. I don't know any of the big kids." It was the children's enthusiasm and excitement on making the connection between an historical figure and the name of their school, which led me to continue. Thirty years later I can't imagine teaching anywhere in the world and not introducing Shakespeare. The study provided tremendous growth, particularly in the area of language and communication and evolved into a learning experience of a lifetime. I have endeavored in my books and workshops for teachers to share the excitement of exploring with children, the timeless emotions and ideas of Shakespeare. </p><p> The comments of two of my children, written at various times in their daily journals show the lasting impression Shakespeare has had on them. </p><p> "Shakespeare is like a big piece of chocolate cake. Once you've started you wish you could go on and on forever, in a non-stopping dream." (Anika, age 7) </p><p> "William's incredible words are like a velvet silk coat that rap around his pure thoughts. His pen writes on like all colors of the wind." (Sean, age 7) </p><p> <b>Lois Burdett</b>'s success in introducing Shakespeare to children is reflected in her growing international reputation. Her books and workshops for teachers have captured the attention and imagination of parents, educators, and lovers of Shakespeare around the world, including the American National Council of Teachers of English and the International Reading Association. Among other commendations, Lois Burdett has received <i>Encyclopedia Britannica's National Award for Early Childhood Education</i>, Canada's <i>Meritorious Service Medal</i>, the Canadian Teachers' Federation's <i>Hilroy Fellowship</i>, and two writers' awards. Burdett's many speaking engagements have included the International Reading Association and the National Council of Teachers of English. Her books, magazine articles, presentations and media interviews are testimony to her strong influence in the education community, where she has also been instrumental in helping teachers to incorporate Shakespeare into early grade curricula. </p></p><h2>Dark Star Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump</h2><p><b><b>Within the concentric circles of Trump's regime lies an unseen culture of occultists, power-seekers, and mind-magicians whose influence is on the rise. In this unparalleled account, historian Gary Lachman examines the influence of occult and esoteric philosophy on the unexpected rise of the alt-right.</b></b><br><br>Did positive thinking and mental science help put Donald Trump in the White House? And are there any other hidden powers of the mind and thought at work in today's world politics? In Dark Star Rising: Magick and Power in the Age of Trump, historian and cultural critic Gary Lachman takes a close look at the various magical and esoteric ideas that are impacting political events across the globe. From New Thought and Chaos Magick to the far-right esotericism of Julius Evola and the Traditionalists, Lachman follows a trail of mystic clues that involve, among others, Norman Vincent Peale, domineering gurus and demagogues, Ayn Rand, Pepe the Frog, Rene Schwaller de Lubicz, synarchy, the Alt-Right, meme magic, and Vladimir Putin and his postmodern Rasputin. Come take a drop down the rabbit hole of occult politics in the twenty-first century and find out the post-truths and alternative facts surrounding the 45th President of the United States with one of the leading writers on esotericism and its influence on modern culture.</p><p><b>Gary Lachman </b>is the author of many books on consciousness, culture, and the Western esoteric tradition, including <i>The Secret Teachers of the Western World; Beyond the Robot: The Life and Work of Colin Wilson; Rudolf Steiner: An Introduction to His Life and Work; In Search of P.

Trump's victory in the November 2016 U.S. presidential election came as a surprise to many, but surely not to Trump. "I am a winner," he said throughout his campaign, and it seems he was right. Winning is important for Trump; as more than one commentator has pointed out, it's no exaggeration to say that it is practically the only important thing for him. As he wrote in his self-help book The Art of the Deal, designed to help its readers become winners too, "I'm the first to admit that I am very competitive and that I'll do nearly anything within legal bounds to win." Most people who know Trump would agree with this self-assessment, although some might suspect that when necessary, he wouldn't be averse to stretching the acceptable boundaries of achieving success just a bit.<br><br> But business is one thing. Surely politics is another. Or is it? Trump's victory left many reeling and set the political pundits pondering on the reasons for his upset. Scrambling for answers, they looked to white middle-class dissatisfaction, Russian intervention, and Hillary Clinton's bad reputation, among other things, for clues. But one sure contribution to Trump's ascendancy must be his positive self-image, his certainty that, as he told his supporters over and over, he is a winner and that he will get what he wants. "People may not always think big themselves," Trump tells his readers, "but they can still get very excited by those who do."<br><br> Trump is one of those who do. He thinks big. There is nothing small about him. From Trump Tower to his aborted plans to build the largest building in the world to his massive Atlantic City casino, practically everything Trump turned his hand to was on a large scale, driven by a desire, with him from an early age, to "make a statement . . . to build something monumental," to take on what he called the "big challenge."<br><br> What accounts for this strident self-confidence, this unshakable assurance of success and driving need to stand out from the mediocre many? Narcissism, megalomania, egomania, selfishness, insensitivity to others, and other personality traits have been offered as explanations for Trump's unswerving optimism and self-belief. To be sure, Trump's psychological profile can accommodate these characteristics and more; as I will try to show, he strikes me as an example of what the writer Colin Wilson called a "Right Man," someone who under no circumstances will admit to being wrong, and who will stop at practically nothing to get his way. But in the flurry of news reports, articles, posts, and tweets that followed in the wake of Trump's victory, one possible reason that could account for Trump's perpetually upbeat demeanor rose out of the mass of sound bites and caught my attention. According to some reports, Trump's at times ruthless belief in his own powers and abilities may lie in his interest in an obscure and somewhat "magical" philosophy known as New Thought, Mental Science, or, as it is sometimes also called, "the power of positive thinking."<br><br> Trump's mentor in positive thinking was the man who popularized the phrase, the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale. In 1952, Peale's book The Power of Positive Thinking appeared and immediately became a success, spending ninety-eight weeks at the top of the New York Times bestseller list and making its author a wealthy man. It is still a healthy seller in the self-help and self-improvement market. Peale read earlier New Thought writers such as Ernest Holmes, Charles Fillmore, and Napoleon Hill and absorbed their fundamental insight, that the mind can influence reality directly, or, as its most basic formula has it, "thoughts are causative." This means that by merely thinking we can change the world around us. If that isn't magical, I don't know what is.<br><br> Peale took this idea and, as the historian of New Thought Mitch Horowitz put it, "reprocessed mind-power teachings through scriptural language and lessons." According to Peale, one could achieve both spiritual and material success in life-he believed that contrary to much ancient wisdom the two are not mutually exclusive-and thinking positively was the way to do it. Trump started attending Peale's sermons as a boy in the 1950s and he took this message to heart. Later he transferred it to the bank.<br><br> Peale played a large role in Trump's life. His parents attended Peale's services at the Marble Collegiate Church on New York's Fifth Avenue and Trump himself was a familiar face among the parishioners there for more than fifty years. Trump was married to his first wife, Ivana Zeln&#x2019;kov&#x2021;, at the church, and rumor had it that he met his second wife, the model Marla Maples, there too. Trump denied this but he did admit to seeing Marla at the services often. In any case, his marriage to Marla was performed in the church by Peale's successor, the Reverend Arthur Caliandro.<br><br> Peale's doctrine of "positive thinking" appealed to Fred Trump, Donald's father, another successful businessman, who said that there was "nobody else like Peale," an estimate Donald agreed with. Trump admitted to two mentors in his life: one was his father, the other was Peale. Given Trump's great respect for his father, this was admiration indeed. Trump called Peale "a great preacher and a great public speaker" and admitted that after hearing one of his sermons he could have "sat there for another hour." What religious or spiritual import Trump absorbed from Peale's sermons is debatable, but Trump was clearly impressed by the Reverend's "speaking ability" and "thought process."<br><br> What did Peale speak of? What were his thoughts about? Mainly about success, in the world of the spirit, yes, but in the material one even more. As Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, said in a podcast, Trump's obsession with winning may be rooted in the kind of this-worldly advice he absorbed at Peale's sermons. The idea that winning was everything was brought home in those Sunday services. "That's a very Norman Vincent Peale notion," Blair said, "that notion of success above all."<br><br> If Trump thought highly of Peale, the admiration was mutual. In 1983, to congratulate him on the opening of Trump Tower, a fifty-eight-story multimillion-dollar contribution to Manhattan's skyline, Peale sent Trump a note predicting that he would be "America's greatest builder." Peale was always impressed by successful people and effective self-promoters, and he was drawn to Trump after seeing him on television. What Peale may have thought of Trump's political success is unknown-he died in 1993-but given that he backed Republicans throughout his life we can imagine. Richard Nixon sought solace at Peale's church after losing the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy, and was later consoled by Peale during the height of the Watergate scandal; Ronald Reagan was a fan too. With Trump in the White House, the idea of being "America's greatest builder" takes on a new meaning.<br><br> Trump took Peale's teachings as a kind of scripture and suggested that he won the approval of his mentor. "He thought I was his greatest student of all time," Trump, no practitioner of false modesty, reported. Peale taught Trump to think only of the best outcomes-to, in the words of an old song, "accentuate the positive, and eliminate the negative." "The mind," Trump believed, "can overcome any obstacle. I never think of the negative." No wonder he's convinced he's a winner.<br><br> It is easy to see New Thought or �positive thinking� as a scam, a metaphysical snake oil sold to the losers in life�s scramble for success. Or as a self-serving religion to its winners, like Trump. Or, as Barbara Ehrenreich does, as a puritanical philosophy that denies valid cause for sorrow or sadness and demands of its practitioners �perpetual effort and self-examination to the point of self-loathing,� not to mention cheerfulness on tap. But a closer look reveals something much more interesting.<br><br> As mentioned, the philosophy of New Thought is based on the idea that the mind can influence reality directly, that mental effort alone can make things happen. In all of its different versions, whether as Mental Science, Science of Mind, Creative Visualization, and others, it emphasizes the same idea. If we can imagine an outcome clearly enough, persistently enough, with enough confidence and commitment, it will materialize. The mind, it affirms, can create reality. We need only believe firmly and it will be so.<br><br> New Thought's insistence on the power of the imagination to create reality seems harmless, if absurd. Most of us accept that reality is not so accommodating and reject the idea outright. Experience, we say, tells us that it just can't be true. But the beliefs of New Thought are rooted in ancient occult ideas, insights into the magical nature of the mind and reality that informed the philosophers of second-century Alexandria and the geniuses of the Renaissance, and which today are seen to be more and more in line with our understanding of physical reality at its most fundamental level.<br><br> Ever since the rise of quantum physics, we've known, as the physicist Werner Heisenberg tells us, that the observer influences the observed. Around the same time as the first forays into the quantum world were being made, in the early twentieth century, the philosopher Edmund Husserl came to a similar conclusion. Husserl's fundamental insight, which informed later developments such as existentialism, is that perception is intentional. That is, for Husserl, consciousness does not merely reflect a world that is already "there," as a mirror does, whether we want it to or not, but actively reaches out and "grabs" it, rather like a mental hand, and, as it were, molds it into shape.<br><br> On a different track, a bit earlier than Husserl, and taking a hint from the German poet and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, the esoteric teacher Rudolf Steiner, most known today as the founder of Waldorf Education, argued that our minds are not mere witnesses but cocreators of the world around us. And today, some of the most respected and successful people on the planet even suggest that the entire world we know is really a kind of collective dream, a simulation, maintained by a secret elite, aware of reality's plasticity and equipped with the knowledge and will to manipulate it-an idea that itself goes back to the beliefs of an ancient mystical sect known as the Gnostics.<br><br> So if people adhering to the philosophy of New Thought, as Trump does, maintain that the mind can create, alter, or affect reality, they seem to be in good company.<br><br> It really should be no surprise that a president who declared himself for �America first� should be a devotee of New Thought. The phrase �new thought� itself was coined by one of America�s greatest thinkers, the nineteenth-century poet, essayist, and orator Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emerson was the leader of a school of philosophy known as Transcendentalism, which is a good candidate for the first homegrown American intellectual movement. Another famous Transcendentalist was Henry David Thoreau, author of the classic Walden. In an essay aptly named �Success,� Emerson wrote: �To redeem defeat by new thought, by firm action, that is not easy, that is the work of divine men.� The notion of success must have been important to Emerson, as he also wrote a poem about it, although some believe the poem attributed to him was really written by Bessie Anderson Stanley. Either way, the kind of success the poem and Emerson�s essay aspire to is not the kind we associate with Trump, having more to do with achieving a kind of inner harmony and leaving the world a better place than building monumental skyscrapers.<br><br> Transcendentalism had its roots in German and English Romanticism, which itself was rooted in notions of the mind and its relation to reality associated with a school of German philosophy known as Idealism. Rudolf Steiner, mentioned above, was deeply influenced by German Idealism. The two philosophers most associated with Idealism were Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.<br><br> Idealism's view of the world reached Emerson through English thinkers like the historian Thomas Carlyle and the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, both of whom were readers of German metaphysics. The simplest way to understand Idealism is to say that it is the polar opposite of the materialism that was the prevalent view of reality in Emerson's time and remains so today. That is to say, where materialism says that "matter," the hard stuff of the physical world, is the fundamental truth about reality, Idealism says that what is "really real" is the mind, consciousness, or spirit, and that the physical world is ultimately an expression of this.<br><br> Kant, for instance, believed that the physical world we see, the universe of space and time, is actually a product of our perceptual apparatus. For Kant our minds somehow organize the raw data of reality into the world perceptible to our senses. Kant did not mean, as some think he did, that we create the world out of whole cloth, that it is a pure fabrication. He is not saying that everything "is in our heads." Such a route leads to solipsism, the belief that "you" are the only thing that you can know, which leaves one in a kind of epistemological bubble, in touch with nothing else. There is a "real world" out there, but we never see it as it is "in itself"-that is, as it appears when we are not perceiving it-but only as our minds deliver it to us. For Kant, it is through the mind's action on the raw data of existence that anything like a "world" appears for us to experience. Hegel got over the hurdle of Kant's verboten world "in itself" by saying that the entire universe, ourselves included, is participating in a vast process of evolution, in which Mind or Spirit, the ultimate reality, comes to awareness of itself through human consciousness.<br><br> There are other aspects of Idealism, and Edmund Husserl, mentioned earlier, was a late exponent of it. The general idea is that for Idealism, the mind is not some accidental passive product of a blind material universe-something many scientists and philosophers persist in insisting on today-but is in fact in charge and at the center of things.<br><br> Transcendentalism had roots in other schools of thought that emphasized the mind over matter. One was Hinduism, especially the spiritual scriptures of the Upanishads, which see the material world as a kind of illusion or dream called "Maya" from which our minds must awaken. Another was the teachings attributed to the mythical founder of magic, Hermes Trismegistus, "thrice-greatest Hermes." As the historian Frances Yates argued, the philosophers of second-century Alexandria and the geniuses of the Renaissance mentioned earlier were devotees of the teachings of the thrice-greatest one.<br><br> Emerson's journals make more than one reference to Hermetic philosophy, which has come down to us in a collection of philosophical, mystical, and magical texts known as the Corpus Hermeticum. Central to Hermetic philosophy is the power of imagination. In Book XI of the Corpus Hermeticum, Nous, or the Universal Mind, tells Hermes that "within God everything lies in imagination." He tells his awestruck student, who receives this revelation in a kind of waking dream, that "if you do not make yourself equal to God you cannot understand him." Such is the power of the imagination that if Hermes were to command his soul to go anywhere, Nous tells him, it would be there "quicker than your command." With imagination he can "grow to immeasurable size," "be free from every body," and "transcend all time." And in a belief that will echo throughout the history of New Thought, Nous counsels Hermes to "Suppose nothing to be impossible for yourself."</p><h2>Computer Simulated Experiments for Electric Circuits Using Electronics Workbench Multisim (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p><b></b> This unique and innovative laboratory manual helps readers learn and understand circuit analysis concepts by using Electronic Workbench software to simulate actual laboratory experiments on a computer.

And in adding the number of dots on a fan: "Instead of seeing groups of threes, / Count by fives and it's a breeze!"<p> Every two-page spread features cheerful computer-generated art by Harry Briggs, depicting rows of camels, beaches full of seashells, and vines laden with grapes. Tang's witty little accompanying verses tickle the fancy even as they challenge the mind. Guided by hints in the verses, readers find solutions to each math riddle, by looking "askew" to find a pattern, subtracting in order to add, or adding numbers that have easy sums before clustering them to add in groups. Solutions and explanations are provided in the back of the book. With a little creativity and common sense, as opposed to formulas and memorization, Tang believes that all kids can do well in math--and have fun while they're at it. Readers of <i>The Grapes of Math</i> are already ahead of the game. (Ages 6 to 10) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>This genuinely clever math book uses rhyming couplets and riddles, as well as visual cues to help the reader find new was to group numbers for quick counting. It's a return to number sets, with non of those boring parentheses and signs. Here the rhyme gives a clue to the new ways of grouping numbers. For example: "Mama mia, pizza pie, / How many mushrooms do you spy? / Please don't count them, ti's too slow, / This hot pie was made to go / Let me give you some advice, / Just do half and count it twice." A quick look at the pizza, and the reader can see each slice has the same number of mushrooms. count by threes for half the pie and double it. Each rhyme is given a double-page spread. The extra-large, brightly colored images leap off the page but never distract from the author's intent. Some riddles are very challenging, but the author provides all the solutions in the back. Once the reader has seen the answers, the strategy is obvious and can be applied to other situations. Great fun for math enthusiasts and creative thinkers, this might also teach adults some new tricks. A winning addition.---Kirkus Reviews, Dec. 1, 2000<br><br>Sixteen rhymed riddles invite readers to discover shortcuts to finding the number of items in double-spread scenes. In each case grouping is the key--finding a pattern among related items and occasionally adding to or subtracting from the total. There's some genuine higher-order mathematical thinking involved here, as children call upon intuition, observation, and strategizing as well as reliable old "math facts" to calculate rather than count. "Knowing Dice" shows six pairs of dice (two rows of double sixes, ones, and threes) and provides the hint, "Before you start please look around,/Adding's fast when tens are found." It suddenly becomes obvious that it will be quicker to group six/one/three four times than to point and count each dot. The "riddles" themselves never amount to more than rhymed instructions, and the workmanlike computer art, which does provide concise diagrams for counting, is flat and bland. Consistent repetition of the same math strategy works well here, though and with appended answers to boast, readers who start out slowly will have lots of opportunity to build aptitude and speed.---Bulletin of the Center for the Chidren's Books, March 2001<br><br>Picture puzzles accompanied by clues in verse encourage readers to embark on some inspired problem solving. Each riddle and an illustration are set on a two- page spread. The goofy rhymes set a humorous tone. Through patterns, grouping, and creative thinking, the problems to be solved will have children adding, subtracting, and multiplying. Throughout, Tang sneaks in useful visual strategies that can be used in solving other computation problems. Bright, appealing computer images add to the playful nature of the title. The solutions provided at the back of the volume include a miniature color reproduction of each picture and a clearly diagrammed answer along with text outlining the process employed to arrive at that answer. A fun addition to classroom and library shelves.---School Library Journal, March 2001<br><br>"Be careful! But don't just add what you first see. A better way there's sure to be." In this fun, creative book, the author has integrated bright, colorful, and eye-appealing computer-generated pictures with clever riddles in rhyme, plays on words, and math, to stretch and open the mind and develop problem-solving skills. Readers are encouraged to look beyond the obvious method of computation (merely counting the objects) and to try other, less obvious ways to find the answer to each riddle. Attractive, two-page spreads showcase each of the three to four double-line riddles, which organize subjects and objects such as ants, gopher holes, fishes, fruits, and foods into symmetrical and asymmetrical patterns and groups.

The subject of a just released biography by Tracy Kidder, Farmer is the author of The Uses of Haiti, Infections and Inequalities, and AIDS and Accusation. Greg Bates is Publisher at Common Courage Press.In this impassioned, sometimes unwieldly, synthesis of history and report, Harvard-based Farmer, who alternates research with medical practice in rural Haiti, offers an indictment of American policy. He traces Haiti's long standing injustice from the sufferings of the 18th century slave economy, and the post-revolution establishment of a still-persistent feudal economy to the U.S. Marine invasion in 1915 and our subsequent support, based on business interests and anticommunism, for tyrants like Papa Doc Duvalier. The democratically elected president Jean-Bertrand Aristide was deposed in a 1991 coup shortly after he began to redress Haiti's ugly inequalities; Farmer (AIDS and Accusation) notes how media reports meshed with the Bush administration's line, and criticizes the Clinton administration's inaction. Departing from his historical narrative, Farmer also decries harassing U.S. policy toward Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; describes the torture death of a peasant as an outgrowth of U.S. military training; and suggests that AIDS in Haiti should not be blamed on images of squalor, but more on "an established political and economic crisis." American remorse, he suggests, would be the first step toward a new commitment to justice. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Television Production Handbook, 12th</h2><p>In the field-defining text TELEVISION PRODUCTION HANDBOOK, author Herbert Zettl emphasizes how production proceeds in the digital age-from idea to image-and how it moves through the three major phases, from preproduction to production to postproduction.

In this benchmark study on Latinos and professional baseball from the 1880s to the present, Adrian Burgos tells a compelling story of the men who negotiated the color line at every turn&#x2015;passing as &#x201c;Spanish&#x201d; in the major leagues or seeking respect and acceptance in the Negro leagues. <br><br>Burgos draws on archival materials from the U.S., Cuba, and Puerto Rico, as well as Spanish- and English-language publications and interviews with Negro league and major league players. He demonstrates how the manipulation of racial distinctions that allowed management to recruit and sign Latino players provided a template for Brooklyn Dodgers&#x2019; general manager Branch Rickey when he initiated the dismantling of the color line by signing Jackie Robinson in 1947. Burgos's extensive examination of Latino participation before and after Robinson's debut documents the ways in which inclusion did not signify equality and shows how notions of racialized difference have persisted for darker-skinned Latinos like Orestes ("Minnie") Mi�oso, Roberto Clemente, and Sammy Sosa.</p><p>"Adrian Burgos is one of best young historians currently working the baseball beat. This is essential reading, not just for baseball aficionados, but anyone interested in the history of American race and ethnic relations."&#x2015;Jules Tygiel, author of <i>Extra Bases: Reflections on Jackie Robinson, Race, and Baseball History</i><br><br>"<i>Playing America's Game</i> is a terrific addition to the growing literature in Latino history.

Damo Mitchell also discusses stillness as the source of movement, the philosophical significance of the Dragon and the pearl, and the means of hardwiring Dao Yin exercises into the energetic body. Central to the discussion is the concept of the spine, and how to wake it up.</p><p>For the first time in the English language, the Dragon exercises &#x2013; Awakening, Swimming, Soaring and Drunken &#x2013; are described in detail, with photographs and step-by-step instructions on each of the exercises as individual therapeutic exercises and as a form.</p></p><p>Internal alchemy in plain EnglishDamo Mitchell has studied the martial, medical and spiritual arts of Asia since the age of four.

Included are The Gorgon&#x2019;s Head, The Golden Touch, The Paradise of Children, The Three Golden Apples, The Miraculous Pitcher, and The Chimaera. In 1838, Hawthorne suggested to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow that they collaborate on a story for children based on the legend of the Pandora&#x2019;s Box, but this never materialized. He wrote <b>A Wonder Book</b> between April and July 1851, adapting six legends most freely from Charles Anton&#x2019;s <i>A Classical Dictionary</i> (1842). He set out deliberately to &#x201c;modernize&#x201d; the stories, freeing them from what he called &#x201c;cold moonshine&#x201d; and using a romantic, readable style that was criticized by adults but proved universally popular with children. With full-color illustrations throughout by Arthur Rackham.</p><p>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804-1864) was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and made his ambition to be a writer while still a teenager. He graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine, where the poet Longfellow was also a student, and spent several years travelling in New England and writing short stories before his best-known novel <b>The Scarlet Letter</b> was published in 1850. His writing was not at first financially rewarding and he worked as measurer and surveyor in the Boston and Salem Custom Houses. In 1853 he was sent to Liverpool as American consul and then lived in Italy before returning to the US in 1860, where he died in his sleep four years later.His interest in Greek mythology led him to suggest to Longfellow in 1838 that they collaborate on a story for children based on the legend of Pandora's Box, but this never materialized. He wrote <b>A Wonder-Book</b> between April and July 1851, adapting six legends most freely from Charles Anton's A Classical Dictionary<i> </i>(1842).<i> </i>He set out deliberately to 'modernize' the stories, freeing them from what he called 'cold moonshine' and using a romantic, readable style that was criticized by adults but proved universally popular with children.Arthur Rackham (1867-1939) was born in south London, the fourth of twelve children. He worked as an office clerk before becoming a full-time illustrator in 1893. His reputation was established with the publication of his illustrations to the Grimm fairy tales in 1900. Thereafter some ninety books appeared with his distinctive pictures, including <b>A Wonder Book</b> in 1922.A Wonder Book For Girls and Boys<br><i>The Gorgon's Head</i>TANGLEWOOD PORCHINTRODUCTORY TO "THE GORGON'S HEAD"Beneath the porch of the country-seat called Tanglewood, one fine autumnal morning, was assembled a merry party of little folks, with a tall youth in the midst of them. They had planned a nutting expedition, and were impatiently waiting for the mists to roll up the hill-slopes, and for the sun to pour the warmth of the Indian summer over the fields and pastures, and into the nooks of the many-colored woods. There was a prospect of as fine a day as ever gladdened the aspect of this beautiful and comfortable world. As yet, however, the morning mist filled up the whole length and breadth of the valley, above which, on a gently sloping eminence, the mansion stood.This body of white vapor extended to within less than a hundred yards of the house. It completely hid everything beyond that distance, except a few ruddy or yellow tree-tops, which here and there emerged, and were glorified by the early sunshine, as was likewise the broad surface of the mist. Four or five miles off to the southward rose thesummit of Monument Mountain, and seemed to be floating on a cloud. Some fifteen miles farther away, in the same direction, appeared the loftier Dome of Taconic, looking blue and indistinct, and hardly so substantial as the vapory sea that almost rolled over it. The nearer hills, which bordered the valley, were half submerged, and were specked with little cloud-wreaths all the way to their tops. On the whole, there was so much cloud, and so little solid earth, that it had the effect of a vision.The children above-mentioned, being as full of life as they could hold, kept overflowing from the porch of Tanglewood, and scampering along the gravel-walk, or rushing across the dewy herbage of the lawn. I can hardly tell how many of these small people there were; not less than nine or ten, however, nor more than a dozen, of all sorts, sizes, and ages, whether girls or boys. They were brothers, sisters, and cousins, together with a few of their young acquaintances, who had been invited by Mr. and Mrs. Pringle to spend some of this delightful weather with their own children, at Tanglewood. I am afraid to tell you their names, or even to give them any names which other children have ever been called by; because, to my certain knowledge, authors sometimes get themselves into great trouble by accidentally giving the names of real persons to the characters in their books. For this reason, I mean to call them Primrose, Periwinkle, Sweet Fern, Dandelion, Blue Eye, Clover, Huckleberry, Cowslip, Squash-Blossom, Milkweed, Plantain, and Buttercup; although, to be sure, such titles might better suit a group of fairies than a company of earthly children.It is not to be supposed that these little folks were to be permitted by their careful fathers and mothers, uncles, aunts, or grandparents, to stray abroad into the woods and fields, without the guardianship of some particularly grave and elderly person. Oh no, indeed! In the first sentence of my book, you will recollect that I spoke of a tall youth, standing in the midst of the children. His name--(and Ishall let you know his real name, because he considers it a great honor to have told the stories that are here to be printed)--his name was Eustace Bright. He was a student at Williams College, and had reached, I think, at this period, the venerable age of eighteen years; so that he felt quite like a grandfather towards Periwinkle, Dandelion, Huckleberry, Squash-Blossom, Milkweed, and the rest, who were only half or a third as venerable as he. A trouble in his eyesight (such as many students think it necessary to have, nowadays, in order to prove their diligence at their books) had kept him from college a week or two after the beginning of the term. But, for my part, I have seldom met with a pair of eyes that looked as if they could see farther or better than those of Eustace Bright.This learned student was slender, and rather pale, as all Yankee students are; but yet of a healthy aspect, and as light and active as if he had wings to his shoes. By the by, being much addicted to wading through streamlets and across meadows, he had put on cowhide boots for the expedition. He wore a linen blouse, a cloth cap, and a pair of green spectacles, which he had assumed, probably, less for the preservation of his eyes than for the dignity that they imparted to his countenance. In either case, however, he might as well have let them alone; for Huckleberry, a mischievous little elf, crept behind Eustace as he sat on the steps of the porch, snatched the spectacles from his nose, and clapped them on her own; and as the student forgot to take them back, they fell off into the grass, and lay there till the next spring.Now, Eustace Bright, you must know, had won great fame among the children, as a narrator of wonderful stories; and though he sometimes pretended to be annoyed, when they teased him for more, and more, and always for more, yet I really doubt whether he liked anything quite so well as to tell them. You might have seen his eyes twinkle, therefore, when Clover, Sweet Fern, Cowslip, Buttercup,and most of their playmates, besought him to relate one of his stories, while they were waiting for the mist to clear up."Yes, Cousin Eustace," said Primrose, who was a bright girl of twelve, with laughing eyes, and a nose that turned up a little, "the morning is certainly the best time for the stories with which you so often tire out our patience. We shall be in less danger of hurting your feelings, by falling asleep at the most interesting points,--as little Cowslip and I did last night!""Naughty Primrose," cried Cowslip, a child of six years old; "I did not fall asleep, and I only shut my eyes, so as to see a picture of what Cousin Eustace was telling about. His stories are good to hear at night, because we can dream about them asleep; and good in the morning, too, because then we can dream about them awake. So I hope he will tell us one this very minute.""Thank you, my little Cowslip," said Eustace; "certainly you shall have the best story I can think of, if it were only for defending me so well from that naughty Primrose. But, children, I have already told you so many fairy tales, that I doubt whether there is a single one which you have not heard at least twice over. I am afraid you will fall asleep in reality, if I repeat any of them again.""No, no, no!" cried Blue Eye, Periwinkle, Plantain, and half a dozen others. "We like a story all the better for having heard it two or three times before."And it is a truth, as regards children, that a story seems often to deepen its mark in their interest, not merely by two or three, but by numberless repetitions. But Eustace Bright, in the exuberance of his resources, scorned to avail himself of an advantage which an older story-teller would have been glad to grasp at."It would be a great pity," said he, "if a man of my learning (to say nothing of original fancy) could not find a new story every day, year in and year out, for childrensuch as you. I will tell you one of the nursery tales that were made for the amusement of our great old grandmother, the Earth, when she was a child in frock and pinafore. There are a hundred such; and it is a wonder to me that they have not long ago been put into picture-books for little girls and boys. But, instead of that, old gray-bearded grandsires pore over them in musty volumes of Greek, and puzzle themselves with trying to find out when, and how, and for what they were made.""Well, well, well, well, Cousin Eustace!" cried all the children at once; "talk no more about your stories, but begin.""Sit down, then, every soul of you," said Eustace Bright, "and be all as still as so many mice. At the slightest interruption, whether from great, naughty Primrose, little Dandelion, or any other, I shall bite the story short off between my teeth, and swallow the untold part. But, in the first place, do any of you know what a Gorgon is?""I do," said Primrose."Then hold your tongue!" rejoined Eustace, who had rather she would have known nothing about the matter. "Hold all your tongues, and I shall tell you a sweet pretty story of a Gorgon's head."And so he did, as you may begin to read on the next page. Working up his sophomorical erudition with a good deal of tact, and incurring great obligations to Professor Anthon, he, nevertheless, disregarded all classical authorities, whenever the vagrant audacity of his imagination impelled him to do so.All new material copyright � 1998 by Tom Doherty Associates, Inc.</p><h2>American Household Botany: A History of Useful Plants, 1620-1900</h2><p>In this fascinating book, celebrated author Judith Sumner rescues from the pages of history the practical experience and botanical wisdom of generations of Americans. Crossing the disciplines of history, ethnobotany, and horticulture --- and with a flair for the colorful anecdote --- Sumner underlines a part of the American story often ignored or forgotten: how European settlers and their descendents made use of the &#34;strange&#34; new plants they found, as well as the select varieties of foods and medicines they brought with them from other continents. From &#34;turkie wheat&#34; (corn) to &#34;tuckahoe&#34; (a Native American source of starch), Sumner describes the transition from wonderment to daily use, as homesteads were built upon and prospered from the plants of the New World. It is a remarkable story of the interdependence of plants and the American home.

Research undertaken during this period, with its focus on genetic structure and function, endowed scientists with then unprecedented power over life. By viewing the new biology as both a scientific and cultural enterprise, Lily E. Kay shows that the growth of molecular biology was a result of systematic efforts by key scientists and their sponsors to direct the development of biological research toward a shared vision of science and society. She analyzes the motivations and mechanisms empowering this vision by focusing on two key institutions: Caltech and its sponsor, the Rockefeller Foundation. Her study explores a number of vital, sometimes controversial topics, among them the role of private power centers in shaping scientific agenda, and the political dimensions of "pure" research. It also advances a sobering argument: the cognitive and social groundwork for genetic engineering and human genome projects was laid by the American architects of molecular biology during these early decades of the project. This book will be of interest to molecular biologists, historians, sociologists, and the general reader alike.<br></p><p>The organizational history of Caltech is the loom on which Kay has woven an intricate fabric of the molecular vision of life.<br>Lily E. Kay received a Ph.D. in the history of science from the Johns Hopkins University in 1987, and was a recipient of a Smithsonian Fellowship at the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. in 1984. She was an Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in bibliography at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, and has taught at the University of Chicago. Since 1989 she has been an assistant professor of history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<br></p><h2>The Dialectics of Seeing: Walter Benjamin and the Arcades Project (Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought)</h2><p><p>Walter Benjamin's magnum opus was a book he did not live to write. In <i>The Dialectics of Seeing</i>, Susan Buck-Morss offers an inventive reconstruction of the Passagen Werk, or Arcades Project, as it might have taken form. Working with Benjamin's vast files of citations and commentary which contain a myriad of historical details from the dawn of consumer culture, Buck-Morss makes visible the conceptual structure that gives these fragments philosophical coherence. She uses images throughout the book to demonstrate that Benjamin took the debris of mass culture seriously as the source of philosophical truth. The Paris Arcades that so fascinated Benjamin (as they did the Surrealists whose "materialist metaphysics" he admired) were the prototype, the 19th century "ur-form" of the modern shopping mall. Benjamin's dialectics of seeing demonstrate how to read these consumer dream houses and so many other material objects of the time<i>&#x2015;</i>from air balloons to women's fashions, from Baudelaire's poetry to Grandville's cartoons&#x2015;as anticipations of social utopia and, simultaneously, as clues for a radical political critique. Buck-Morss plots Benjamin's intellectual orientation on axes running east and west, north and south&#x2015;Moscow Paris, Berlin-Naples&#x2015;and shows how such thinking in coordinates can explain his understanding of "dialectics at a standstill." She argues for the continuing relevance of Benjamin's insights but then allows a set of "afterimages" to have the last word. </p></p><p>Walter Benjamin&#39;s magnum opus was a book he did not live to write.

He emerged six weeks later with the final script of &#34;Death of a Salesman&#34; - a painful examination of American life and consumerism. Opening on Broadway the following year, Miller&#39;s extraordinary masterpiece changed the course of modern theatre. In creating Willy Loman, his destructively insecure anti-hero, Miller himself defined his aim as being &#39;to set forth what happens when a man does not have a grip on the forces of life.&#39;</p><p>Arthur Miller's 1949 <i>Death of a Salesman</i> has sold 11 million copies, and Willy Loman didn't make all those sales on a smile and a shoeshine. This play is the genuine article--it's got the goods on the human condition, all packed into a day in the life of one self-deluded, self-promoting, self-defeating soul. It's a sturdy bridge between kitchen-sink realism and spectral abstraction, the facts of particular hard times and universal themes. As Christopher Bigsby's mildly interesting afterword in this 50th-anniversary edition points out (as does Miller in his memoir, <i>Timebends</i>), Willy is closely based on the playwright's sad, absurd salesman uncle, Manny. But of course Miller made Manny into Everyman, and gave him the name of the crime commissioner Lohmann in Fritz Lang's angst-ridden 1932 Nazi parable, <i>The Testament of Dr. Mabuse</i>.<p> The tragedy of Loman the all-American dreamer and loser works eternally, on the page as on the stage. A lot of plays made history around 1949, but none have stepped out of history into the classic canon as <i>Salesman</i> has. Great as it was, Tennessee Williams's work can't be revived as vividly as this play still is, all over the world. (This edition has edifying pictures of Lee J. Cobb's 1949 and Brian Dennehy's 1999 performances.) It connects Aristotle, <i>The Great Gatsby</i>, <i>On the Waterfront</i>, David Mamet, and the archetypal American movie antihero. It even transcends its author's tragic flaw of pious preachiness (which undoes his snoozy <i>The Crucible</i>, unfortunately his most-produced play).</p><p> No doubt you've seen Willy Loman's story at least once. It's still worth reading. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Stacy Keach and Jane Kaczmarek stars in Arthur Miller's 1949 masterpiece, a searing portrait of the physical, emotional, and psychological costs of the American dream. Willy Loman (Keach) is the play's iconic traveling salesman, whose family is torn apart by his desperate obsession with greatness and social acceptance. As his two sons cast about aimlessly for their station in life, Willy begins to come unraveled when the reality of his life threatens his long-cherished illusions. <p> A full cast L.A.

The author's appreciation of even the least prepossessing of these bivalves is infectious. Jacobsen makes the case that 'every oyster is a tide pool in miniature, a poem built of salt water and phytoplankton that nods to whatever motes of meaning shaped it.'&nbsp;East Beach Blondes, farmed in Rhode Island, taste like 'brine and ozone; a boardwalk in the rain'; Maine's wild-harvested Belons remind him of 'hazelnuts and anchovies fried in seal fat, with a squishy crunch like jellyfish salad.' In terms of presence, New Brunswick's Beausoleils are 'as clean and inoffensive as a Jehovah's Witness," and wild James River specimens have "oversized muscles and a pale potbelly, like an aging professional wrestler.'

This is must-reading for everyone who cares about America&#x2019;s fate in the 21st century.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014; Judy Woodruff, Senior Correspondent for <em>The PBS NewsHour</em></p><p>&nbsp;Families and Work Institute President Ellen Galinsky (<em>Ask the Children, The Six Stages of Parenthood</em>) presents a book of groundbreaking advice based on the latest research on child development.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>"What kind of person do I want my child to be?"</p></blockquote><p>There are hundreds of books that give parents advice on everything from weaning to toilet training, from discipline to nutrition. But in spite of this overwhelming amount of information, there is very little research-based advice for parents on how to raise their children to be well rounded and achieve their full potential, helping them learn to take on life's challenges, communicate well with others, and remain committed to learning. These are the "essential life skills" that Ellen Galinsky has spent her career pursuing, through her own studies and through decades of talking with more than a hundred of the most outstanding researchers in child development and neuroscience. The good news is that there are simple everyday things that all parents can do to build these skills in their children for today and for the future. They don't cost money, and it's never too late to begin.</p><p>In <em>Mind in the Making</em>, Ellen Galinsky has grouped this research into seven critical areas that children need most: (1) focus and self control; (2) perspective taking; (3) communicating; (4) making connections; (5) critical thinking; (6) taking on challenges; and (7) self-directed, engaged learning. For each of these skills, Galinsky shows parents what the studies have proven, and she provides numerous concrete things that parents can do&#x2014;starting today&#x2014;to strengthen these skills in their children. These aren't the kinds of skills that children just pick up; these skills have to be fostered. They are the skills that give children the ability to focus on their goals so that they can learn more easily and communicate what they've learned. These are the skills that prepare children for the pressures of modern life, skills that they will draw on now and for years to come.</p><p><em>Mind in the Making</em> is a truly groundbreaking book, one that teaches parents how to give children the most important tools they will need. Already acclaimed by such thought leaders as T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., David A. Hamburg, M.D., Adele Faber, and Judy Woodruff, <em>Mind in the Making</em> is destined to become a classic in the literature of parenting.</p><p>Ellen Galinsky, president and cofounder of the Families and Work Institute, helped establish the field of work and family life at Bank Street College of Education, where she was on the faculty for twenty-five years. At the institute, she continues to conduct seminal research on the changing workforce and changing family. Her more than forty books and reports include <em>Ask the Children: The Breakthrough Study That Reveals How to Succeed at Work and Parenting</em> and the now-classic <em>The Six Stages of Parenthood</em>. She has received numerous honorary degrees and awards, including the 2004 Distinguished Achievement Award from Vassar College. She served as the elected president of the National Association for the Education of Young Children and was elected a fellow of the National Academy of Human Resources in 2005.

Everything. Yet, a number of theories are converging on the possibility that our universe may be but one among many parallel universes populating a vast multiverse. Here, Briane Greene, one of our foremost physicists and science writers, takes us on a breathtaking journey to a multiverse comprising an endless series of big bangs, a multiverse with duplicates of every one of us, a multiverse populated by vast sheets of spacetime, a multiverse in which all we consider real are holographic illusions, and even a multiverse made purely of math--and reveals the reality hidden within each.<br><br>Using his trademark wit and precision, Greene presents a thrilling survey of cutting-edge physics and confronts the inevitable question: How can fundamental science progress if great swaths of reality lie beyond our reach? <i>The Hidden Reality</i> is a remarkable adventure through a world more vast and strange than anything we could have imagined.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, January 2011</strong>: Take any of physics' major theories of the fundamental nature of the universe, extrapolate its math to the logical extreme, and you get some version of a (so far unobservable) parallel universe. And who better to navigate these hypothetical versions of the "multiverse" than Brian Greene? Normally an unflinching apologist for string theory, the bestselling author of <em>The Elegant Universe</em> and <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> here treats all viable alternate realities to a laudably fair shake. For a book exploring the most far-reaching implications of bleeding-edge mathematics, <em>The Hidden Reality</em> is surprisingly light on math, written as it is "for a broad audience ... its only prerequisite the will to persevere." Such perseverance pays off with a motley cast of potential universes featuring doppelg�ngers, strings, branes, quantum probabilities, holographs, and simulated worlds. The result is that rare accomplishment in science writing for a popular audience: a volume that explains the science and its consequences while stimulating the imagination of even the uninitiated. <p><strong>Oliver Sacks on <em>The Hidden Reality</em></strong></p> <p><b>Oliver Sacks was born in London and educated in London, Oxford, California, and New York.

His newest book, <em>The Mind's Eye</em>, was published in October, 2010.</b></p> <p> </p> <p>Brian Greene is not only a profound cosmological thinker--a pioneer of string theory--but a writer of exceptional clarity and charm. His books--<em>The Elegant Universe</em> and <em>The Fabric of the Cosmos</em> among them--take one ever deeper into a universe stranger and more wonderful than anyone could have conceived a generation ago. <em>The Hidden Reality</em> takes us deeper still, and it has a special personal quality and warmth that is evident from the opening of the book, when Greene recollects how, as a boy, he was fascinated by the multiple reflections in parallel mirrors. He has never lost this childlike wonder at the world of physics, but he brings it now to examining theories of multiple universes, of the continual birth of universes, starting long before our own. . . and destined to continue, perhaps, to the end of time.</p> <p>In the 1930s, as a boy myself, I read <em>The Mysterious Universe</em> by James Jeans. Jeans was, like Greene, a brilliant theoretical astronomer and equally mesmerizing writer. I thought Jeans's book was the most exciting, revelatory book I had ever read, and now, seventy years later, I feel the same excitement reading Brian Greene's new book, where every chapter opens level after level of previously unimaginable, mind-expanding realities.</p><b>Brian Greene</b> received his undergraduate degree from Harvard University and his doctorate from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar.

Stouthearted chickadees are singing in the day, just like they have done every other winter's dawn, but when this same sun sets tonight, I will be miles away from them, and inside an unfamiliar house. There will be no reminders anywhere that Henry was ever mine. Not visible ones, anyway.<br><br> I kneel on the dead grass, brittle with icy moisture. The fabric of my skirt draws in the chilled damp, as if it is parched with thirst. The growing wetness at my knees is unhurried and easy, like a clean, slow blade. I look at the little marble slab that bears Henry's name and the carving of a sweet lamb curled up among lilies, and I'm reminded again that he was my angel child, even before he flew away to heaven.<br><br> From the moment I held my boy, glistening and new, I knew that he wasn't like the other babies I'd given birth to. He wasn't like my girls. They'd slipped out annoyed by the noise and chill and sharp edges of this world. Not Henry. He didn't cry. He didn't curl his tiny hands into fists. He didn't shout his displeasure at being pulled out of the only safe place he knew.<br><br> When the doctor placed him in my arms, Henry merely looked at me with eyes so blue they could've been sapphires. He held my gaze like he knew who I was. Knew everything about me. Like he still had the breath of eternity in his lungs.<br><br> He didn't care when I parted the folds of his blanket to look at his maleness and marvel at the pearly sheen of his skin against mine. I could scarcely believe I'd given birth to a boy after three girls and so many years since the last one. I just kept staring at Henry and he just let me.<br><br> When Thomas was let into the room, he was as astonished that we had a son as I was. The girls were, too. They followed in right after their father, even though it was the middle of the night, and we all gazed and grinned at the little man-child, the quiet lad who did not cry.<br><br> My father-in-law came over the next morning, as did Thomas's brothers and their wives, all of them smelling of dried tobacco leaves and spice. My parents came, too, and my sister, Jane, who was newly pregnant with her own child after several years of hoping and praying for a baby. They all marveled at how beautiful Henry was, how calm, how enchanting his gaze and how sweet his temperament. My mother and Thomas's sisters-in-law stared at him like I'd done the night before, amazed as I had been at how serene this baby was. They had known, too, without knowing, that something wasn't right.<br><br> The few months we had with Henry were wonder filled and happy. He did all the things a baby does that make you smile and laugh and want to kiss his downy head. When he needed something, like my breast or a clean diaper or affection, he didn't wail; he merely sighed a sweet little sound that if it were made of words would have started with "If it's not too much trouble . . ." We didn't know he didn't have the physical strength to exert himself. His perfectly formed outsides hid the too-small, too-weak heart that my body had made for him.<br><br> And yet had God asked me ahead of time if I wanted this sweet child for just shy of half a year, I still would have said yes. Even now, eight weeks after Henry's passing, and even when I hold Jane's sweet little newborn, Curtis, I would still say yes.<br><br> I don't know if Thomas feels this way, and I know the girls don't. Evelyn is still sad, Maggie is still angry, and Willa is still bewildered that Henry was taken from us. I can't say why I am none of those things anymore. What I feel inside, I'm not sure there are words to describe. I should still be sad, angry, and bewildered, but instead I feel a numbness regarding Death that I've told no one about. Not even Thomas.<br><br> I no longer fear Death, though I know that I should. I'm strangely at peace with what I used to think of as my enemy. Living seems more the taskmaster of the two, doesn't it? Life is wonderful and beautiful but oh, how hard it can be. Dying, by contrast, is easy and simple, almost gentle. But who can I tell such a thing to? No one. I am troubled by how remarkable this feeling is.<br><br> This is why I changed my mind about moving to Philadelphia. I'd said no the first time Thomas's uncle made his offer even though I could tell my husband was interested. Back then I couldn't imagine leaving this sleepy little town where I've lived all my life, couldn't imagine leaving my parents, though I've never been especially dependent on their subtle shows of affection. I didn't want to move to the city, where the war in Europe would somehow seem closer, didn't want to uproot the girls from the only home they've ever known. Didn't want to tear myself away from all that was familiar. Uncle Fred wrote again a couple months after Henry was born, and Thomas had said we needed to think carefully before turning down a second invitation.<br><br> "Uncle Fred might take his offer to one of my brothers," Thomas had told me.<br><br> I truly would have given the matter more serious thought if Henry hadn't begun his slow ascent away from us right about the same time. When my son's fragile heart finally began to number his days, nothing else mattered but holding on to him as long as we could. Thomas didn't bring up the matter again when the third letter from Uncle Fred arrived last week. My husband thinks I cannot leave this little mound of grass.<br><br> But the truth is, I have come out from under the shroud of sorrow a different person. I no longer want to stay in this place where Henry spent such a short time. I don't want Thomas shading a view of the wide horizon with hands calloused from binder leaves. I don't want the girls to end up mirroring this life of mine, in a place where nothing truly changes but the contours of your heart.<br><br> More than that, I want to know why Death seems to walk beside me like a companion now rather than prowling behind like a shadowy specter. Surely the answers await me in Uncle Fred's funeral parlor, where he readies the deceased for their journeys home. Thomas would've gone to his grave rolling cigars for other men to smoke, but now he will one day inherit Uncle Fred's mortuary business and then he won't be under the thumb of anyone.<br><br> I don't know what it is like to be the wife of an undertaker. I only know that I need to remember how it was to keep Death at a distance.<br><br> I kneel, kiss my fingertips, and brush them against the H carved into the cold stone.<br><br> And I rise from the wet ground without saying good-bye.<br><br> Chapter 2<br><br> Maggie<br><br> I will miss the curing barn in autumn, when the tobacco leaves hang from the laths like golden skirts in a wardrobe. I've always loved how in October the papery leaves smell like cedar, molasses, and tree bark. There won't be anything like them in Philadelphia. And we'll be long gone by the time October comes around again.<br><br> The curing barn is my favorite place because it's either as busy as a beehive or as still as a painting. After that first killing frost it's like the painting, so still and quiet you can forget there's a changing world outside. No one has to do anything in the curing barn in the fall except have a look-see now and then to make sure none of the tobacco leaves are getting moldy. In the fall, we're all in the rolling room. I'm twelve but I've the delicate hands of a young woman, Grandad says, so I roll a nice cigar. Evie just turned fifteen and doesn't like rolling; she'd rather be reading under the locust tree when the weather's nice, but she likes to buy books with the money she earns. Our younger sister, Willa, is only six. It would've been a long while before Grandad told her she had hands as graceful as a dancer and rolled a cigar better than a man did.<br><br> I don't usually spend much time in the barn when the tobacco leaves are finished with their curing, but that was where I was when Mama told Papa she'd seen Uncle Fred's letter. I'd come home from school, done my chores, and then walked across the snowy field from our house to lie among the few remaining wooden slats that still held their toast-colored leaves. I'd been going to the curing barn a lot since my baby brother died, but Papa had forgotten I was there.<br><br> "I've been thinking about Philadelphia," Mama said. Papa had been checking the empty laths for rot and weak spots. He was a couple rows over from me, and I was on my back on the dirt behind a crate, looking up at the leafy ball gowns. The last time Mama had been to Philadelphia was when Henry was still alive. She and Evie had taken him to see a doctor, and they'd come home with the awful news that he wasn't going to get better. There was no doctor in the city or on the face of the whole earth who could cure Henry.<br><br> "I think we should go," Mama had said.<br><br> At first I thought Willa must be sick now, and that was why Mama wanted to go to Philadelphia again. Or Evie. Or maybe I was the sick one and I didn't even know it yet. But then Mama added she'd seen Uncle Fred's latest letter asking Papa to come work for him in Philadelphia, and now she was thinking it was a good idea after all.<br><br> "What made you change your mind?" Papa sounded surprised.<br><br> A second or two went by before Mama answered him. "Everything."<br><br> Papa paused a moment, too, before he said, "If we do this, I don't think we can undo it."<br><br> "I know."<br><br> "We won't be able to get back here that often, Pauline. Not at first."<br><br> "I know that, too," Mama said. "If I can bring the girls back to see the family for a week or two in the summer, I can be content with that."<br><br> "I don't suppose your parents will be too keen about this. Especially your mother."<br><br> "No, maybe not. But you know how she is. She'll quietly stew on it a bit, and then she'll be done. I think in the end she wants us to be happy. I know that's what I'd want for us if I were her."<br><br> A funny, spirally feeling had started to wind its way inside me as my parents talked to each other. Papa and Mama were talking about moving to the city to live with Uncle Fred, a man I had only met once. He came out to Quakertown when Granny died. Not Mama's mama, Papa's. When I was eight.<br><br> Papa had said, "Are you sure now? Are you sure this is what you want to do?"<br><br> "It's what you want to do, isn't it?" Mama replied.<br><br> "It will mean a good life for you and the girls. A much better life than what I'm giving you here."<br><br> "You've given us a good life, Tom," Mama said.<br><br> "I want to give you a better one."<br><br> Then Papa said he needed to tell Grandad and break the news to the family and they'd need to sell the house. They talked for a few more minutes, but I wasn't listening to everything they said. I was thinking about leaving my friends and the other family members and the curing barn. I couldn't remember what Uncle Fred's business was, but I was positive it wasn't growing tobacco and rolling cigars. Not in the city. It was so strange to me that my parents could just decide we were leaving and we'd leave. How could we move away from where we'd buried Henry?<br><br> When Mama left, I stood up slowly so that I would see Papa before he saw me. But he was looking my direction and he saw my head clear the laths. I'm not afraid of my father. He doesn't yell or curse or storm about when he's angry, but he can look like he wants to. He's tall like Grandad and has the same coffee brown eyes that glitter like stars both when he's happy and when he's sad. And I guess when he's surprised, too.<br><br> "I didn't know you were still in here," he said.<br><br> "I know."<br><br> "Did you hear everything?"<br><br> I nodded.<br><br> He gave me a very serious look. "You can't say anything to anybody, not even your sisters, until I talk to Grandad first. You understand?"<br><br> "Are we moving to Philadelphia?"<br><br> He hesitated a second or two before answering, like he almost couldn't believe it was true himself. "Yes," he said.<br><br> "Why? What's wrong with where we live right now?"<br><br> Papa moved from his row to mine. "There's nothing wrong with where we live right now. I just have a chance to give you girls a much better home. Better schooling. Better everything. My uncle Fred doesn't have any children. He has no one to leave his home and business to. He wants to leave them to me when he dies. To us. He has a very nice house, Mags. Electric lights in every room. Hot water from the tap."<br><br> "And so just like that, we're going?"<br><br> "Mama and I've been thinking on it awhile."<br><br> "All my friends are here."<br><br> "You will make new ones. I promise you will."<br><br> "Henry's here." My throat felt hot and thick as I said Henry's name. I looked away from Papa, and in the direction of the cemetery, even though I couldn't see it from inside the curing barn.<br><br> Papa put his hands gently on my shoulders so that I would turn my head to face him again. "Henry's in heaven. He's not in the graveyard here-you know that. We're not leaving him; we're taking him with us in our hearts."<br><br> I reached up to flick away a couple tears that wanted to trail down my face.<br><br> "I need you to promise you won't say anything. Not yet," Papa said.<br><br> I didn't answer.<br><br> "Maggie, I want your word now."<br><br> "I promise," I finally whispered.<br><br> "All right, then." He took one hand off my shoulders, but left the other one as he began to lead us toward the big door that led outside. "When I tell your sisters, that's when you'll know it's okay to tell other people. Not until then."</p><h2>Legend: The Graphic Novel</h2><p>Born into an elite family in one of the Republic's wealthiest districts, fifteen-year-old June is a military prodigy.&nbsp;Born into the slums of the Republic&#x2019;s Lake Sector, fifteen-year-old Day is the country&#x2019;s most wanted criminal.

It looks out of place up there. Most of the pictures on the screens are of happy things: smiling children standing under a bright blue sky, tourists posing before the Golden Gate Ruins, Republic commercials in neon colors. There&#x2019;s also anti-Colonies propaganda. <i>�The Colonies want our land,&#x201d;</i> the ads declare. <i>�They want what they don&#x2019;t have. Don&#x2019;t let them conquer your homes! Support the cause!&#x201d;</i></p> <p> Then there&#x2019;s my criminal report. It lights up the JumboTrons in all its multicolored glory:</p> <p> WANTED BY THE REPUBLIC</p> <p> FILE NO: 462178-3233 �DAY&#x201d;</p> <p> -------------------------------------</p> <p> WANTED FOR ASSAULT, ARSON, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OF MILITARY PROPERTY, AND HINDERING THE WAR EFFORT 200,000 REPUBLIC NOTES FOR INFORMATION LEADING TO ARREST</p> <p> They always have a different photo running alongside the report. One time it was a boy with glasses and a head full of thick copper curls. Another time it was a boy with black eyes and no hair at all. Sometimes I&#x2019;m black, sometimes white, sometimes olive or brown or yellow or red or whatever else they can think of.</p> <p> In other words, the Republic has no idea what I look like. They don&#x2019;t seem to know much of <i>anything</i> about me, except that I&#x2019;m young and that when they run my fingerprints they don&#x2019;t find a match in their databases. That&#x2019;s why they hate me, why I&#x2019;m not the most <i>dangerous</i> criminal in the country, but the most <i>wanted</i>. I make them look bad.</p> <p> It&#x2019;s early evening, but it&#x2019;s already pitch-black outside, and the JumboTrons&#x2019; reflections are visible in the street&#x2019;s puddles. I sit on a crumbling window ledge three stories up, hidden from view behind rusted steel beams. This used to be an apartment complex, but it&#x2019;s fallen into disrepair. Broken lanterns and glass shards litter the floor of this room, and paint is peeling from every wall. In one corner, an old portrait of the Elector Primo lies faceup on the ground. I wonder who used to live here�no one&#x2019;s cracked enough to let their portrait of the Elector sit discarded on the floor like that.</p> <p> My hair, as usual, is tucked inside an old newsboy cap. My eyes are fixed on the small one-story house across the road. My hands fiddle with the pendant tied around my neck.</p> <p> Tess leans against the room&#x2019;s other window, watching me closely. I&#x2019;m restless tonight and, as always, she can sense it.</p> <p> The plague has hit the Lake sector hard. In the glow of the JumboTrons, Tess and I can see the soldiers at the end of the street as they inspect each home, their black capes shiny and worn loose in the heat. Each of them wears a gas mask. Sometimes when they emerge, they mark a house by painting a big red <i>X</i> on the front door. No one enters or leaves the home after that�at least, not when anyone&#x2019;s looking.</p> <p> �Still don&#x2019;t see them?&#x201d; Tess whispers. Shadows conceal her expression.</p> <p> In an attempt to distract myself, I&#x2019;m piecing together a makeshift slingshot out of old PVC pipes. �They haven&#x2019;t eaten dinner. They haven&#x2019;t sat down by the table in hours.&#x201d; I shift and stretch out my bad knee.</p> <p> �Maybe they&#x2019;re not home?&#x201d;</p> <p> I shoot Tess an irritated glance. She&#x2019;s trying to console me, but I&#x2019;m not in the mood. �A lamp&#x2019;s lit. Look at those candles. Mom would never waste candles if no one was home.&#x201d;</p> <p> Tess moves closer. �We should leave the city for a couple weeks, yeah?&#x201d; She tries to keep her voice calm, but the fear is there. �Soon the plague will have blown through, and you can come back to visit. We have more than enough money for two train tickets.&#x201d;</p> <p> I shake my head. �One night a week, remember? Just let me check up on them one night a week.&#x201d;</p> <p> �Yeah. You&#x2019;ve been coming here <i>every</i> night this week.&#x201d;</p> <p> �I just want to make sure they&#x2019;re okay.&#x201d;</p> <p> �What if you get sick?&#x201d;</p> <p> �I&#x2019;ll take my chances. And you didn&#x2019;t have to come with me. You could&#x2019;ve waited for me back in Alta.&#x201d;</p> <p> Tess shrugs. �<i>Somebody</i> has to keep an eye on you.&#x201d; Two years younger than me�although sometimes she sounds old enough to be my caretaker.</p> <p> We look on in silence as the soldiers draw closer to my family&#x2019;s house. Every time they stop at a home, one soldier pounds on the door while a second stands next to him with his gun drawn. If no one opens the door within ten seconds, the first soldier kicks it in. I can&#x2019;t see them once they rush inside, but I know the drill: a soldier will draw a blood sample from each family member, then plug it into a handheld reader and check for the plague. The whole process takes ten minutes.</p> <p> I count the houses between where the soldiers are now and where my family lives. I&#x2019;ll have to wait another hour before I know their fate.</p> <p> A shriek echoes from the other end of the street. My eyes dart toward the sound and my hand whips to the knife sheathed at my belt. Tess sucks in her breath.</p> <p> It&#x2019;s a plague victim. She must&#x2019;ve been deteriorating for months, because her skin is cracked and bleeding everywhere, and I find myself wondering how the soldiers could have missed this one during previous inspections. She stumbles around for a while, disoriented, then charges forward, only to trip and fall to her knees. I glance back toward the soldiers. They see her now. The soldier with the drawn weapon approaches, while the eleven others stay where they are and look on. One plague victim isn&#x2019;t much of a threat. The soldier lifts his gun and aims. A volley of sparks engulfs the infected woman.</p> <p> She collapses, then goes still. The soldier rejoins his comrades.</p> <p> I wish we could get our hands on one of the soldiers&#x2019; guns. A pretty weapon like that doesn&#x2019;t cost much on the market�480 Notes, less than a stove. Like all guns, it has precision, guided by magnets and electric currents, and can accurately shoot a target three blocks away. It&#x2019;s tech stolen from the Colonies, Dad once said, although of course the Republic would never tell you that. Tess and I could buy five of them if we wanted. . . . Over the years we&#x2019;ve learned to stockpile the extra money we steal and stash it away for emergencies. But the real problem with having a gun isn&#x2019;t the expense. It&#x2019;s that it&#x2019;s so easy to trace back to you. Each gun has a sensor on it that reports its user&#x2019;s hand shape, thumbprints, and location. If that didn&#x2019;t give me away, nothing would. So I&#x2019;m left with my homemade weapons, PVC pipe slingshots, and other trinkets.</p> <p> �They found another one,&#x201d; Tess says. She squints to get a better look.</p> <p> I look down and see the soldiers spill from another house. One of them shakes a can of spray paint and draws a giant red <i>X</i> on the door. I know that house. The family that lives there once had a little girl my age. My brothers and I played with her when we were younger�freeze tag and street hockey with iron pokers and crumpled paper.</p> <p> Tess tries to distract me by nodding at the cloth bundle near my feet. �What&#x2019;d you bring them?&#x201d;</p> <p> I smile, then reach down to untie the cloth. �Some of the stuff we saved up this week. It&#x2019;ll make for a nice celebration once they pass the inspection.&#x201d; I dig through the little pile of goodies inside the bundle, then hold up a used pair of goggles. I check them again to make sure there are no cracks in the glass. �For John. An early birthday gift.&#x201d; My older brother turns nineteen later this week. He works fourteen-hour shifts in the neighborhood plant&#x2019;s friction stoves and always comes home rubbing his eyes from the smoke. These goggles were a lucky steal from a military supply shipment.</p> <p> I put them down and shuffle through the rest of the stuff. It&#x2019;s mostly tins of meat and potato hash I stole from an airship&#x2019;s cafeteria, and an old pair of shoes with intact soles. I wish I could be in the room with all of them when I deliver this stuff. But John&#x2019;s the only one who knows I&#x2019;m alive, and he&#x2019;s promised not to tell Mom or Eden.</p> <p> Eden turns ten in two months, which means that in two months he&#x2019;ll have to take the Trial. I failed my own Trial when I was ten. That&#x2019;s why I worry about Eden, because even though he&#x2019;s easily the smartest of us three boys, he thinks a lot like I do. When I finished my Trial, I felt so sure of my answers that I didn&#x2019;t even bother to watch them grade it. But then the admins ushered me into a corner of the Trial stadium with a bunch of other kids. They stamped something on my test and stuffed me onto a train headed downtown. I didn&#x2019;t get to take anything except the pendant I wore around my neck. I didn&#x2019;t even get to say good-bye.</p> <p> Several different things could happen after you take the Trial.</p> <p> You get a perfect score�1500 points. No one&#x2019;s <i>ever</i> gotten this�well, except for some kid a few years ago who the military made a goddy fuss over. Who knows what happens to someone with a score that high? Probably lots of money and power, yeah?</p> <p> You score between a 1450 and a 1499. Pat yourself on the back because you&#x2019;ll get instant access to six years of high school and then four at the top universities in the Republic: Drake, Stanford, and Brenan. Then Congress hires you and you make lots of money. Joy and happiness follow. At least according to the Republic.</p> <p> You get a good score, somewhere between 1250 and 1449 points. You get to continue on to high school, and then you&#x2019;re assigned to a college. Not bad.</p> <p> You squeak by with a score between 1000 and 1249. Congress bars you from high school. You join the poor, like my family. You&#x2019;ll probably either drown while working the water turbines or get steamed to death in the power plants.</p> <p> You fail.</p> <p> It&#x2019;s almost always the slum-sector kids who fail. If you&#x2019;re in this unlucky category, the Republic sends officials to your family&#x2019;s home. They make your parents sign a contract giving the government full custody over you. They say that you&#x2019;ve been sent away to the Republic&#x2019;s labor camps and that your family will not see you again. Your parents have to nod and agree. A few even celebrate, because the Republic gives them one thousand Notes as a condolence gift. Money and one less mouth to feed? What a thoughtful government.</p> <p> Except this is all a lie. An inferior child with bad genes is no use to the country. If you&#x2019;re lucky, Congress will let you die without first sending you to the labs to be examined for imperfections.</p> <p> Five houses remain. Tess sees the worry in my eyes and puts a hand on my forehead. �One of your headaches coming on?&#x201d;</p> <p> �No. I&#x2019;m okay.&#x201d; I peer in the open window at my mother&#x2019;s house, then catch my first glimpse of a familiar face. Eden walks by, then peeks out the window at the approaching soldiers and points some handmade metal contraption at them. Then he ducks back inside and disappears from view. His curls flash white-blond in the flickering lamplight. Knowing him, he probably built that gadget to measure how far away someone is, or something like that.</p> <p> �He looks thinner,&#x201d; I mutter.</p> <p> �He&#x2019;s alive and walking around,&#x201d; Tess replies. �I&#x2019;d say that&#x2019;s a win.&#x201d;</p> <p> Minutes later, we see John and my mother wander past the window, deep in conversation. John and I look pretty similar, although he&#x2019;s grown a little stockier from long days at the plant. His hair, like most who live in our sector, hangs down past his shoulders and is tied back into a simple tail. His vest is smudged with red clay. I can tell Mom&#x2019;s scolding him for something or other, probably for letting Eden peek out the window. She bats John&#x2019;s hand away when a bout of her chronic coughing hits her. I let out a breath. So. At least all three of them are healthy enough to walk. Even if one of them is infected, it&#x2019;s early enough that they&#x2019;ll still have a chance to recover.</p> <p> I can&#x2019;t stop imagining what will happen if the soldiers mark my mother&#x2019;s door<i>.</i> My family will stand frozen in our living room long after the soldiers have left. Then Mom will put on her usual brave face, only to sit up through the night, quietly wiping tears away. In the morning, they&#x2019;ll start receiving small rations of food and water and simply wait to recover. Or die.</p> <p> My mind wanders to the stash of stolen money that Tess and I have hidden. Twenty-five hundred Notes. Enough to feed us for months . . . but not enough to buy my family vials of plague medicine.</p> <p> The minutes drag on. I tuck my slingshot away and play a few rounds of Rock, Paper, Scissors with Tess. (I don&#x2019;t know why, but she&#x2019;s crazy good at this game.) I glance several times at my mother&#x2019;s window, but don&#x2019;t see anyone. They must have gathered near the door, ready to open it as soon as they hear a fist against the wood.</p> <p> And then the time comes. I lean forward on the ledge, so far that Tess grips my arm to make sure I don&#x2019;t topple to the ground. The soldiers pound on the door. My mother opens it immediately, lets the soldiers in, and then closes it. I strain to hear voices, footsteps, anything that might come from my house. The sooner this is all over, the sooner I can sneak my gifts to John.</p> <p> The silence drags on. Tess whispers, �No news is good news, right?&#x201d;</p> <p> �Very funny.&#x201d;</p> <p> I count off the seconds in my head. One minute passes. Then two, then four, and then finally, ten minutes.</p> <p> Then fifteen minutes. Twenty minutes.</p> <p> I look at Tess. She just shrugs. �Maybe their reader&#x2019;s broken,&#x201d; she suggests.</p> <p> Thirty minutes pass. I don&#x2019;t dare move from my vigil. I&#x2019;m afraid something will happen so quickly that I&#x2019;ll miss it if I blink. My fingers tap rhythmically against the hilt of my knife.</p> <p> Forty minutes. Fifty minutes. An hour.</p> <p> �Something&#x2019;s wrong,&#x201d; I whisper.</p> <p> Tess purses her lips. �You don&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;</p> <p> �Yes I do. What could possibly take this long?&#x201d;</p> <p> Tess opens her mouth to reply, but before she can say anything, the soldiers are exiting my house, single file, expressionless. Finally, the last soldier shuts the door behind him and reaches for something tucked at his waist. I suddenly feel dizzy. I know what&#x2019;s coming.</p> <p> The soldier reaches up and sprays one long, red, diagonal line on our door. Then he sprays another line, making an <i>X.</i></p> <p> I curse silently under my breath and start to turn away�</p> <p> �but then the soldier does something unexpected, something I&#x2019;ve never seen before.</p> <p> He sprays a third, vertical line on my mother&#x2019;s door, cutting the <i>X</i> in half.</p> <p> <b>1347 HOURS.</b></p> <p> <b>D</b>RAKE<b> U</b>NIVERSITY<b>, B</b>ATALLA SECTOR<b>.</b></p> <p> <b>72�F </b>INDOORS<b>.</b></p> <p> <b>I&#x2019;M SITTING IN MY DEAN SECRETARY&#x2019;S OFFICE.

Ever since Mia's decision to stay - but not with him - Adam's career has been on a wonderful trajectory. His album, borne from the anguish and pain of their breakup, has made him a bona fide star. And Mia herself has become a top-rate cellist, playing in some of the finest venues in the world. When their respective paths put them both in New York City at the same time, the result is a single night in which the two reunite - with wholly satisfying results.<br><br> And don't miss Gayle's newest novel, JUST ONE DAY and the forthcoming companion, JUST ONE YEAR.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011</strong>: In the three years since the tragic accident Mia barely survived in <i>If I Stay</i>, she and high school ex-boyfriend Adam have lived separate lives on opposite coasts. But then Adam, now the dissatisfied front man of popular LA-based band Collateral Damage, stops over in New York City for one night before kicking off the European leg of his tour. It happens to be the same evening that Mia, now well on her way to becoming a renowned cellist, is performing at Carnegie Hall. Adam buys a ticket, planning to slip in and out, but Mia spots him and for the first time in years they&#x2019;re face-to-face with each other and their shared past. Over the course of one evening, as Adam and Mia traverse the city&#x2019;s streets, they relive the four days Mia spent in the intensive care unit as well as her departure to Juilliard and from the life she knew. Emotionally raw and incredibly moving, Gayle Forman again showcases her considerable talent for drawing complex characters who face impossible decisions and then bear the consequences. Equally as compelling as <i>If I Stay</i>, <i>Where She Went</i> is powerful, heartbreaking, and everything fans of Mia, Adam, and Forman could hope for. <i>--Jessica Schein</i><p></p><p></p> <p></p> <strong>Lauren Oliver and Gayle Forman: Author One-on-One</strong> <p> Lauren Oliver is the author of <em>Delirium</em> and <em>Before I Fall</em>. A graduate of the University of Chicago and the MFA program at New York University, Lauren is a full-time writer and lives in Brooklyn, New York. Recently she sat down with Gayle Forman to discuss their work. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Gayle interviewed Lauren. </p> <p> <em>From Lauren Oliver</em>: I&#x2019;ve had a writer&#x2019;s crush on Gayle Forman ever since I read an early copy of <em>If I Stay</em>. It&#x2019;s a shattering and ultimately life-affirming book, and I was completely transported by the lyricism of Gayle&#x2019;s prose. Like the music it often references, her writing seems to float gracefully over and around its themes of life and choice and love&#x2014;always love. We&#x2019;ve been trying to grab coffee in our neighborhood for over a year (and have even run into each other on the street outside the local grocery store). Finally, on the eve of the publication of <em>Where She Went</em> (April 5, 2011), the gorgeous follow-up to <em>If I Stay</em>, we found time to grab lunch and gab. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> Had you always intended to write a sequel to <em>If I Stay</em>? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> No. I had no intention of writing a sequel, in fact. But in the way that characters sometimes behave, Adam and Mia had different ideas. I&#x2019;d started on a totally different book, actually, but they kept banging on the drum in my head. And I felt I had left them in a difficult place. At the end of <em>If I Stay</em>, I knew they both they had a rough couple of years ahead of them. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> How hard was it to switch POV and enter Adam&#x2019;s mind? To write from a boy&#x2019;s perspective? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> It wasn&#x2019;t very hard, actually. I knew the characters so well. I knew him so well. It was actually strange to know a character so well without actually having seen through his eyes. But in some ways, I could understand Adam even more than I could understand Mia when I started writing her. Mia was so different from me. One thing that was hard: Adam was so angry at Mia, and so I was angry at Mia, and that was disconcerting. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> Is there transference of emotions when you write? Do you feel you become your characters in some way? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> Totally. I let my sister read a draft of <em>Where She Went</em> and she said, &#x201c;I forgive you for being such a brat.&#x201d; Because I&#x2019;d been totally channeling that anger. <em>If I Stay</em> actually was kind of a beautiful place to be, because Mia was surrounded by so much love. <em>Where She Went</em> was a lot harder, even though nobody dies. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> So Mia is quite different from you, then? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> Completely. When I first started writing her, and even though she inhabited me, I was like, <em>where are you coming from</em>? I feel like when I talk, I sound like a teenage valley girl. She seems so wise to me, like such an old soul. I certainly can see elements of me, but she definitely feels quite different and other. But I loved her and felt very protective of her and I knew her very well. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> How did you know that so much time would have to elapse between books? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> I just knew that it had to be several years later. The same that I knew that it couldn&#x2019;t be from Mia&#x2019;s perspective. If we were in Mia&#x2019;s head again it would be another exploration of her grief. And it had to be several years later for Adam and Mia to be ready for change. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> What&#x2019;s your writing process? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> My process is sort of similar to yours. I don&#x2019;t start by writing the ending of the books, but I know what the ending will be. Although with <em>If I Stay</em>, I didn&#x2019;t know what Mia&#x2019;s choice would be, though I knew the book would end by her choosing. </p> <p>I totally get ideas in the shower too! I&#x2019;m a firm believer that the muse visits when you are working&#x2014;sitting at the computer&#x2014;but the moments when things have clicked have so often been in the shower. And then I&#x2019;ll be sitting at my computer in a towel, and my apartment is freezing. We don&#x2019;t have one of those hot New York apartments. I should really invest in a bathrobe. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> But you don&#x2019;t outline? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> I do not outline. I love exploring the twists and turns to get me to that ending, the unexpected places. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> I really love what you said about the muse visiting when you are working. So you&#x2019;re pretty much always working on a book? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> Yes. Momentum breeds momentum and inertia breeds inertia. Even if something&#x2019;s not working, I&#x2019;ll keep working, just to have something to work on, if that makes sense. And sometimes one failed project leads to another project that works. But you can&#x2019;t get to 60 mph from a full stop. It never happens that something springs to life from nothing. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> Music is so important in both <em>If I Stay</em> and <em>Where She Went</em>. So it begs the question: do you listen to music when you write? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> When I wrote <em>If I Stay</em>, I listened to music the whole time...There was this one song, <em>Falling Slowly</em>, which I listened to every time I began writing. It was a Pavlovian thing. I&#x2019;d listen to it, it would make me cry, and then I would start working. I wrote <em>Where She Went</em> in dead silence until about 3/4 of the way through. The switch coincided with a point at which <em>Adam</em> stops being estranged from music. He borrows an ipod and after that moment, I started listening to music again while I was writing. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> What are the themes that interest you as a writer? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> Love, I think, in all of its dimensions. The cost of unconditional love...what happens in the absence of love. Love is what we all live and breathe for. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> What was the proportion of fiction versus real life in <em>If I Stay</em>? What about <em>Where She Went</em>? I know that <em>If I Stay</em> was actually based off a real-life event. </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> In <em>If I Stay</em> some of the characters were based on people I knew and the premise was based on a real-life event. <em>Where She Went</em> passed fully into the realm of fiction. There&#x2019;s a certain transcendence in the aftermath of tragedy...you find something deeper in yourself. But eventually all that passes, and you have to simply get on with it. That was the germ of reality in <em>Where She Went</em>. The gritty reality of grieving and getting on with life. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> What&#x2019;s the best and worst part about publishing a follow-up novel to a super successful book? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> I worry about letting people down, of course. But mostly, I put the pressure on myself. I want every book to be better than the one before. </p> <p> <strong>Lauren:</strong> What about the best? </p> <p> <strong>Gayle:</strong> I&#x2019;m just so glad that we write YA because we have such a broad and vocal readership. </p>Gayle Forman is an award-winning, internationally bestselling author and journalist.

Babies: A Catholic Perspective on How and Why God Makes Babies (for ages 9 and up)</h2><p>Theology of the Body (TOB) Children's Book. Through the use of beautiful illustrations and simple yet truthful and medically correct language, this book explains the majesty God designed into the full, free, faithful, and fruitful communion of spouses that allows &#x201c;man&#x201d; to &#x201c;image&#x201d; the Trinity, who creates out of love, in order to share love. Complete with biblical and literary references, and granted both the Nihil Obstat (by Msgr. Brian Bransfield) and the Imprimatur (by Archbishop Charles Chaput), Wonderfully Made! Babies will enrich your child&#x2019;s understanding of life&#x2019;s bigger picture while affirming his or her personal worth and place in the world. Here's what one priest has to say about the book: &#x201c;Our Lord Jesus, the Son of the living God, said &#x2018;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.&#x2019; Matthew 19:14.

This little book is the "Theology of the Body" for children--get it and give it to children, give it to schools and to Religious-ed classes. I see Pope John Paul II laughing in heaven, amazed that his Theology of the Body has been written in such a way that children can understand it. May he intercede and bless the authors and the illustrator.&#x201d;Fr. Pio Mandato, FMHJ</p><p>Ellen Giangiordano is a wife and mother of five children who is an attorney by training.

The house stood tall and wide atop a hill of dense woodland. In front of the house was the sea. Behind the house was nothing.<br> <br>Elizabeth thought but did not say that the house was clearly haunted and that she would not countenance spending as long as one night in it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elizabeth, this is my mother, Arlette. And Mummy, this is Elizabeth&#x2014;or Lizzy, as we usually call her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When she&#x2019;s being good!&#x201d; Alison, Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother, interjected.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; rejoined her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend. &#x201c;When she&#x2019;s being good. When she&#x2019;s not being good, she&#x2019;s plain old Elizabeth.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend ruffled Elizabeth&#x2019;s hair and squeezed her shoulder, and Elizabeth grimaced. She stared at the ground, at the brown and red tessellated tiles beneath her feet, cut and formed into the shapes of stars. She&#x2019;d known this moment was coming for two weeks, since Christmas Eve, when they&#x2019;d gotten the call that had spoiled their Christmas Day. Two weeks ago Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother and her boyfriend had sat her down and explained that his mother, a woman called Arlette Lafolley, a person of whose existence Elizabeth had been blissfully unaware before that moment, had fallen in her house on an island called Guernsey and broken something, and had been advised by her GP that she should have someone living with her.<br> <br>And so it had been decided, somehow, somewhere, behind some closed door or other, that the solution to this problem was for Elizabeth and her mother to leave the only home that Elizabeth had ever known, a neat redbrick bungalow on the outskirts of Farnham in Surrey, and go to this island to live with this woman for at least, her mother had told her, three months, and to do so within two weeks.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elizabeth,&#x201d; said her mother&#x2019;s boyfriend, &#x201c;are you going to say hello?&#x201d; <br> <br>Elizabeth tried not to squirm, but it was very hard not to squirm when you were in a haunted house with your mother&#x2019;s boyfriend&#x2019;s hand on your shoulder, being introduced to a terrible old woman whose frail bones had conspired to crumble and break and destroy your life. Elizabeth lifted her gaze to the woman in front of her but not before noticing, with some surprise, that the woman was wearing red silk shoes adorned with matching rosettes. Elizabeth&#x2019;s gaze also took in black lacy tights over shapely calves, then a coat of full, luxuriant mink that hung from throat to mid-shin, and a face, round and elfin, like that of a child, pink lips, pearly blue eyelids, and a matching mink hat. On each earlobe, a small chunk of diamond shone dully in the muted candlelight.<br> <br>Elizabeth gulped. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>The lady in the fur coat paused for a beat and then bowed down so that her head was level with Elizabeth&#x2019;s and said, &#x201c;Hello, Elizabeth. I&#x2019;ve heard a lot about you.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was impossible to gauge from her expression whether these things she had heard had been bad or good, but then her face softened and she smiled, and Elizabeth smiled back and said, &#x201c;I like your shoes.&#x201d; <br> <br>Arlette smiled too and said, &#x201c;Then you have very good taste. Now come in and get warm, I&#x2019;ve lit the fire.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth and her mother exchanged looks. Elizabeth&#x2019;s mother had met this woman before, about two years ago, when she and her boyfriend had only just started dating. She had described her then as &#x201c;colorful&#x201d; but &#x201c;mean.&#x201d; And someone &#x201c;not to be crossed.&#x201d; She probably had not thought, as she&#x2019;d passed these judgments upon her boyfriend&#x2019;s mother to her daughter, that one day she and her daughter would have cause to come and live with her. And she&#x2019;d probably forgotten ever saying them. But Elizabeth hadn&#x2019;t forgotten. She had come to this place with a full armory of attitude and verve, ready to take whatever this lady had to dish up. And then been momentarily thrown by a pair of scarlet silk shoes.<br> <br>But still, red silk shoes. Even on an old lady, that was rather spectacular. Elizabeth had had to endure all sorts of nonsensical after-school dance classes in order to get her mother to buy her interesting shoes. Slivers of flesh-colored leather with silky ribbons for ballet, and chunky-heeled shoes with buttoning straps for flamenco and jazz. Never anything in red silk. Surely, she thought, surely anyone capable of owning a pair of shoes that magnificent must be halfway decent.<br> <br>She followed the old lady down the hall and into a room on the left. It was entered by a tall door with an ornately stained window in the fanlight.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to excuse the damp,&#x201d; said Arlette. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t opened this room up for quite a while. And it&#x2019;s too cold to have a window open.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth brought her arms around herself and shuddered. The room was tall and bare, with wood-paneled walls and pointy furniture, and everything was brown apart from a roaring fire in the hearth around which they all huddled on a tapestry-covered ottoman.<br> <br>The adults were all having a conversation about the journey and about the delivery van and about the weather and about Arlette&#x2019;s hip (she had walked with a stick and a fairly pronounced limp down the hallway). Elizabeth got to her feet and went to the window. It was leaded and a touch baggy, and framed by dismal gray nets. Through it Elizabeth could see, in all directions, a vast expanse of blankness. She sighed and returned to the fire, the cold of the room seeping into the very marrow of her, the smell of damp firewood and unloved furnishings and cold, cold coldness leaching into everything.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got blow heaters coming in the van,&#x201d; said Jolyon, rubbing his hands together briskly. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll plug them in when they arrive.&#x201d; He said this to Elizabeth and her mother in a perky, reassuring manner, but it was clear to them that it would require more than two cheap blow heaters to take the chill off this sad old house. &#x201c;And then,&#x201d; he continued, somewhat desperately, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll take a look at the heating.&#x201d;<br> <br>His mother threw him a disparaging look. &#x201c;Not necessary,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The air will warm up pretty quickly over the next few weeks. Remember, we&#x2019;ve the Gulf Stream here. By the time you&#x2019;ve worked out how to fix the heating and found someone willing to come and sort it for a sum of money that will not make your eyeballs bleed, it will be summer again. Every room has a fireplace. It&#x2019;s all a matter of wearing the right clothes. And keeping to just a couple of rooms. And, of course, lots and lots of hot drinks. Warming ourselves up from the inside out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elizabeth stared at Arlette&#x2019;s furry coat and hat and thought, Well, yes, that is easy for you to say, you are practically wearing a bear.<br> <br>Elizabeth was put in a room on the first floor that was papered with a green and blue vertical stripe that looked like old men&#x2019;s pajamas. There were three small leaded windows overlooking the sea. It was even colder up here, and when she breathed out hard, her breath appeared around her like a wraith.<br> <br>Her bed sat on the side of the room opposite the windows. It was built from some kind of very heavy, darkly veneered wood and covered over with a cheap-looking duvet with a blue case. Atop the two biscuit-thin pillows sat a threadbare blue knitted rabbit that looked like it had been left there to die.<br> <br>Elizabeth thought of her bed at home. It was queen-size, with a white powder-sprayed metal frame with curly bits in it and knobs made out of clear Perspex. Her mother had bought it for her for her tenth birthday; &#x201c;a double bed for double figures.&#x201d; She also had a queen-size duvet, clothed in a white cover embroidered all over with rose sprigs, and a pillowcase trimmed with lace upon which Elizabeth arranged all her teddy bears every morning before she left for school. She&#x2019;d asked her mum if they could bring the bed, if they could squeeze it into the big van with all their other things, but her mum had smiled apologetically and said, &#x201c;Sorry, sweetheart, no beds. It&#x2019;ll still be there when we get back.&#x201d;<br> <br>And that had been that.<br> <br>Elizabeth rested her rucksack on the floor and unzipped it with icy fingers. Inside she felt around for the soothing plush of Katerina&#x2019;s ears. She tugged at the fabric and pulled her free of the piles of books and games and notepads she&#x2019;d packed this morning to relieve the boredom of an eight-hour journey. Elizabeth pulled the bear close to her face and breathed in the smell, and she felt her heart ache as the heady, honeyed scent of home filled her senses. With her nose still to the bear, she looked around the cold, Spartan room, she gazed at the endless concrete gray of the sea through the mean little windows, and then she stalked across the room, picked up the ugly knitted rabbit, opened a window, and hurled the thing as far as she could into the cold gray yonder.</p><h2>Prayers That Bring Change</h2><p>Use the authority God has given you to move to the next level in your prayer life with this collection of proclamation prayers by best-selling author Kimberly Daniels.

At least what was left of it. Everywhere he looked was death. What few trees and foliage the Elgen had left on the island were still burning or glowing in heaps of red and orange embers. Around them scorched human skeletons and bones lay strewn across the landscape like straw after a windstorm. The island&#x2019;s sand, now mostly melted to glass, glistened where streams of morning sunlight broke through the retreating storm clouds, reflecting the vibrant prisms of the color spectrum. Had it not been so terrible, it almost would have been beautiful.<br> <br>On one side of the crystalline beach were the only signs of life&#x2014;the scurrying Tuvaluan natives who, along with the Electroclan, had survived the Elgen attack and taken shelter in the underground bunker before the explosion. Welch had left the natives water, food, and the Joule&#x2019;s remaining life rafts to make their journey back to their home islands. Their leader, Enele Saluni, grandson of the former Tuvaluan prime minister (who, at Hatch&#x2019;s orders, had been sentenced to life on display, naked in a monkey cage in the Tuvaluan capital), saluted Welch from the distance. Welch lowered his binoculars and saluted back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s below,&#x201d; Jack said, climbing up the conning tower behind Welch. &#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone who made it,&#x201d; Jack said hoarsely.<br> <br>Welch raised his binoculars one more time and scanned the horizon along the northern end of the island, looking for signs of Elgen. Again he saw nothing of the once terrible force&#x2014;at least nothing that was still alive. &#x201c;All right. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Welch followed Jack down the inside of the Joule&#x2019;s conning tower, pausing on the ladder near the top as hydraulic pistons pulled the hatch closed. Pneumatic clamps hissed and clicked around him as the steel hatch was locked airtight. Then Welch climbed down to join the others in the Conn, the Joule&#x2019;s control center.<br> <br>&#x201c;Take us down,&#x201d; Welch said to the boat&#x2019;s COB&#x2014;the chief of the boat&#x2014;as he stepped from the ladder onto the metal floor.<br> <br>Even though the Joule could travel as much as fifteen knots faster above surface, Welch didn&#x2019;t want to take the chance of being seen. Outside of the Joule&#x2019;s crew members who Welch had set adrift, he didn&#x2019;t know who had survived. He didn&#x2019;t even know if Hatch had survived. Perhaps no one had. But still, there was no sense in taking chances.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; the Elgen COB replied, speaking into his microphone. &#x201c;Down twenty meters.&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Including the COB, there were five Elgen still on the Joule and one Fijian servant. Twelve hours earlier, when Welch and his Glows&#x2014;Quentin, Tara, Torstyn, and Cassy&#x2014;had hijacked the Joule, they&#x2019;d disarmed the seventeen-man crew and then sent everyone off the boat, except for the Joule&#x2019;s COB and the four crew members needed to operate the ship.<br> <br>Welch had also sent J.D., the boat captain who had betrayed the Electroclan by sailing them into a trap, and his crew with the Elgen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Man, don&#x2019;t leave me here,&#x201d; J.D. had said, clinging to the one life raft Welch had left them. &#x201c;I helped you take this boat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky I&#x2019;m leaving you alive,&#x201d; Welch said. &#x201c;But don&#x2019;t get used to it. When Hatch finds out that you helped us hijack the Joule, he&#x2019;ll feed you to his rats.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You will all die,&#x201d; J.D. said. &#x201c;Like rats.&#x201d;<br> <br>Welch looked at him stoically. &#x201c;Everyone dies. Some just sooner than others. And some, one bite at a time.&#x201d;<br> <br>J.D. looked at Welch hatefully. &#x201c;I will die as I choose. No one takes my life but me.&#x201d; Then, letting go of the raft, he sunk down in the black water beneath the heaving waves. He never came up again.<br> <br>&#x201c;So ends the traitor,&#x201d; Welch said to himself.<br> <br>Quentin had disabled the raft&#x2019;s outboard motor and radio with an EMP so the Elgen would not be able to alert anyone for hours, giving Welch and the Glows the time they needed to get back to Hades to rescue their friends. That was, if their friends were still alive. Even thirty miles from Hades, they saw and heard the massive explosion. Welch&#x2019;s first thought was that Hatch had detonated some kind of nuclear device to destroy the island. But there was no mushroom cloud or, outside of the flash, evidence of a nuclear weapon. They weren&#x2019;t going to leave the islands until they knew for certain if any of their friends had survived.<br> <br>Hours later, when Welch and company surfaced the Joule off the coast of Hades, they couldn&#x2019;t believe what they saw. All the Elgen boats were sunk or burning on the surface. They were relieved to find the Electroclan huddled on the beach.<br> <br>Welch and Quentin sailed to shore to pick up their friends, leaving Cassy, Torstyn, and Tara on board to secure the ship.<br> <br>Ten minutes after Welch and Quentin left, one of the Elgen crewmen approached Cassy. &#x201c;Hey, baby. We&#x2019;ve been cooped up a long, long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not your baby,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t take another step.&#x201d;<br> <br>He kept walking. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a little girl like you going to do to stop a big man like me?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cassy pursed her lips. &#x201c;You had to ask.&#x201d; She froze the man&#x2019;s entire body, including his lungs. He fell over, dropping to the floor with a loud thud.<br> <br>When she let him go, he gasped for breath, then said, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t do that again.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When I tell you to stop walking, you stop walking. Next time you won&#x2019;t breathe again. Ever. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br> <br>She smiled sardonically. &#x201c;?&#x2018;Ma&#x2019;am&#x2019;? What happened to &#x2018;baby&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>Jack was the last to board, gathering the teens in one corner of the Conn. The room echoed with the sounds of grief&#x2014;sobbing and crying. Especially from Taylor, who was inconsolable. &#x201c;Michael,&#x201d; she said over and over. &#x201c;My Michael.&#x201d;<br> <br>McKenna&#x2019;s arms were around Taylor, the two of them slightly rocking.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe he&#x2019;s gone,&#x201d; Taylor said.<br> <br>McKenna wiped her eyes. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe any of this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ostin watched them silently, too emotional to speak. His eyes were red and swollen.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew he had a hero&#x2019;s heart,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;I knew it the moment he came to my door to ask me to take him to California.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then Cassy walked into the Conn. She glanced around the room, then asked, &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Michael?&#x201d;<br> <br>From everyone&#x2019;s silence she knew something bad had happened. She raised her hand to her mouth. &#x201c;Oh no.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t make it,&#x201d; Quentin said.<br> <br>Cassy started crying. She looked over at Taylor. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cassy walked over, and the two of them hugged.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know you cared about him too,&#x201d; Taylor said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay that you loved him too,&#x201d; she said softly. &#x201c;He was easy to love.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael&#x2019;s not the only one we lost,&#x201d; Ian said. &#x201c;We lost Gervaso and Tanner, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack swallowed in pain, fighting back tears. Gervaso had been more of a father to him than his real father. Abigail put her arms around him and comforted him with her powers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;I want to feel the pain.&#x201d;<br> <br>Abigail stopped pulsing. &#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack furtively wiped his eyes, then looked out at the others. &#x201c;Gervaso told me that when he was in ranger training, his drill sergeant told them that they were all going to hell. The only consolation was that they&#x2019;d already been there, so it wouldn&#x2019;t matter.&#x201d; He rubbed his eyes. &#x201c;If there&#x2019;s a heaven, I think there&#x2019;s a special pass for heroes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I think so too,&#x201d; Zeus said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s far too few of them as it is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Someday we&#x2019;ll return,&#x201d; Welch said. &#x201c;When the world has changed. We&#x2019;ll build a memorial to the three of them. Then the whole world will know what they&#x2019;ve sacrificed.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was something hopeful in what Welch had said. After a few more minutes Welch said, &#x201c;You must all be exhausted. Get some rest.&#x201d; He turned to Tara. &#x201c;Take them to their bunks.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir,&#x201d; Tara said. &#x201c;Everyone, follow me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Except Cassy,&#x201d; Welch said. &#x201c;You stay with me. I need some backup.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d;<br> <br>The rest of the teens followed Tara, single file, out of the Conn. None of them had ever seen anything like the Joule before, which wasn&#x2019;t surprising, since the Joule was the only ship of its kind ever built&#x2014;a hybrid vault, ship, and submarine. It was tight and narrow with no portholes. Air, mostly recycled, was continually pumped throughout the vessel, and filled the echoing chambers with a continual hissing. The walls were all riveted metal, as was the floor, which had been coated with thick rubberized flooring that softened and dulled the sound of their footsteps as they walked.<br> <br>Tara led them down a narrow corridor past the commander&#x2019;s quarters to the first of two bunk rooms. The compartment was designed solely for sleeping. It was only twelve feet wide, with pipe-framed cots on both sides of the room with trampoline-like mattresses. The cots were connected, by brackets, on one side to the wall, while the other side was supported from the ceiling by chains. The beds were stacked four high, with only a few feet of headroom; the bottom bunks were suspended only three inches above the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is where we sleep,&#x201d; Tara said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s tight, but the Joule is basically a submarine. Everything&#x2019;s tight. Welch wants us all to stay in the same room so we can lock the Elgen crew members in the other.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care where I sleep,&#x201d; Jack said. &#x201c;As long as I&#x2019;m horizontal. I feel like I&#x2019;m sleepwalking.&#x201d; He took off his shoes and then, using the edges of the lower bunks as steps, climbed up onto the top bunk. Everyone else claimed bunks, except Taylor, who just stood in the middle of the room looking lost.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, honey,&#x201d; Abigail said. &#x201c;You need some rest. You&#x2019;ll feel a little better after you get some rest.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sleep won&#x2019;t take this away,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;Unless I never wake up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t take it away, but I can help. Just lie down right here, sweetie,&#x201d; Abigail said, pulling down the covers on a bottom bunk.<br> <br>Taylor took off her shoes and crawled out across the cot, lying on her back.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now just relax,&#x201d; Abigail said. She put her hands on Taylor&#x2019;s head and lightly pulsed. At first, Taylor shuddered; then her body calmed and she breathed out deeply. Within moments she was asleep.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have a beautiful gift,&#x201d; Tara said softly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Abigail said.<br> <br>For a moment everyone was quiet and the only sounds were the constant hissing of the Joule&#x2019;s air system, Jack&#x2019;s snoring, and the strained, eerie groaning of the vessel. Every now and then the boat creaked like a heavy door on a rusty hinge.<br> <br>&#x201c;Does that sound ever stop?&#x201d; McKenna asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably not,&#x201d; Ostin said, speaking for the first time since they&#x2019;d boarded. His voice was raw and strained.<br> <br>The pain in his voice hurt her. &#x201c;Hey, tell me some facts about submarines.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; Ostin said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not in the mood.&#x201d;<br> <br>McKenna frowned. &#x201c;How deep do you think we are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ostin breathed out slowly. &#x201c;The Joule can dive to six hundred feet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What makes that sound?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ostin sniffed, then said softly, &#x201c;At six hundred feet the water pressure is 282.6 pounds per square inch. That&#x2019;s a lot of pressure on a pressurized can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard that the Elgen carry all their wealth in this boat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not all of it,&#x201d; Ostin said. &#x201c;Just enough for a rainy day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be a lot of rain,&#x201d; Ian said, suddenly joining the conversation. &#x201c;There are stacks of gold bullion running two feet high across the length of the boat.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;d have to use that much weight as ballast,&#x201d; Ostin said.<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s also diamonds and boxes of paper currency. I could open the safes that hold them,&#x201d; Ian said. &#x201c;Just for fun.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be fun to see,&#x201d; McKenna answered. &#x201c;Maybe someday we&#x2019;ll share in all that loot.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe,&#x201d; Ostin said, sounding not at all interested.<br> <br>Abigail glanced back at McKenna with a sad smile, then climbed onto the bunk above Taylor.<br> <br>An hour later Cassy walked into the bunk room. &#x201c;Lunch is ready,&#x201d; she said softly. No one moved. Everyone was asleep. After a few minutes, Cassy went back to the Conn to keep Welch company.</p><h2>Olga and the Smelly Thing from Nowhere (Olga, 1)</h2><p><p><strong>A Bank Street College of Education Best Children's Book of the Year!</strong></p><p><strong>Meet Olga, the amazing child scientist who LOVES animals (because they are super-cute)!

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books. The Bond novels have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide, boosted by the hugely successful film franchise that began in 1962 with the release of <i>Dr. No</i>. </p><p>He married Anne Rothermere in 1952. His story about a magical car, written in 1961 for their only son Caspar, went on to become the well- loved novel and film <i>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</i>. </p><p>Fleming died of heart failure on August 12, 1964, at the age of fifty-six.</p>'You know what?' said Major Dexter Smythe to the octopus. 'You're going to have a real treat today if I can manage it.' <p>He had spoken aloud and his breath had steamed up the glass of his Pirelli mask. He put his feet down to the sand and stood up. The water reached to his armpits. He took off the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round the glass, rinsed it clean and pulled the rubber band of the mask back over his head. He bent down again.</p> <p>The eye in the mottled brown sack was still watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly an inch or two out of the shadows and quested vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost. Dexter Smythe smiled with satisfaction. Given time, perhaps one more month on top of the two during which he had been chumming up with the octopus, and he would have tamed the darling. But he wasn't going to have that month. Should he take a chance today and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear, to the tentacle - shake it by the hand, so to speak? No, Pussy, he thought. I can't quite trust you yet. Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of the hole and up his arm. He only needed to be dragged down less than two feet, the cork valve on his mask would automatically close and he would be suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned. He might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it would take more than that to kill Pussy. No. Perhaps later in the day. It would be rather like playing Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one-odds. It might be a quick, a whimsical way out of his troubles! But not now. It would leave the interesting question unsolved. And he had promised that nice Professor Bengry at the Institute. Dexter Smythe swam leisurely off towards the reef, his eyes questing for one shape only, the squat sinister wedge of a scorpion fish, or, as Bengry would put it, Scorpaena Plumieri.</p> <p>Major Dexter Smythe, OBE, Royal Marines (Retd), was the remains of a once brave and resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had made easy sexual conquests all his military life and particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who manned the com-munications and secretariat of the very special task force to which he had been attached at the end of his service career. Now he was fifty-four, slightly bald and his belly sagged in the Jantzen trunks. And he had had two coronary thromboses. His doctor, Jimmy Greaves (who had been one of their high poker game at Queen's Club when Dexter Smythe had first come to Jamaica), had half-jocularly described the later one, only a month before, as 'the second warning'. But, in his well-chosen clothes, his varicose veins out of sight and his stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the North Shore, and it was a mystery to his friends and neighbours why, in defiance of the two ounces of whisky and ten cigarettes a day to which his doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably drunk, every night.</p> <p>The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe had arrived at the frontier of the death-wish. The origins of this state of mind were many and not all that complex. He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica, and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid hardwood, under the varnished surface the termites of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin and general disgust with himself had eroded his once hard core into dust. Since the death of Mary two years before, he had loved no one. He wasn't even sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that, every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and her gay, untidy, chiding and often irritating presence, and though he ate their canapes and drank their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the international riff-raff with whom he consorted on the North Shore. He could perhaps have made friends with the soldier elements, the gentleman-farmers inland, or the plantation owners on the coast, the professional men and the politicians, but that would mean regaining some serious purpose in life which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely unwilling to do. So Major Smythe was bored, bored to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates he had easily acquired from a local doctor. The lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff was a tenuous one. Heavy drinkers veer towards an exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic four - Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. The Sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of hysteria and idiocy. The Phlegmatic sinks into a morass of sullen gloom. The Choleric is the fighting drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life in prison for smashing people and things, and the Melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness and tears. Major Smythe was a Melancholic who had slid into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa is symptomatic), its beach and the coral reef beyond. The fish were his particular favourites. He referred to them as 'people' and, since reef fish stick to their territories as closely as do most small birds, after two years he knew them all intimately, 'loved' them and believed that they loved him in return.</p> <p>They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos know their keepers, because he was a daily and a regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up sea eggs and urchins for the small carnivores and bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones, and now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the reef and through the channels that led out to deep water, his 'people' swarmed around him fearlessly and expectantly, darting at the tip of the three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon, flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli and even, in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles, nipping softly at his feet and legs. Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these brilliantly coloured little 'people', but today he had a job to do and while he greeted them in unspoken words - 'Morning, Beau Gregory' to the dark-blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright-blue spots, the 'jewel fish' that exactly resembles the starlit fashioning of a bottle of Worth's 'Vol de Nuit'; 'Sorry. Not today, sweetheart,' to a fluttering butterfly fish with false black 'eyes' on its tail and, 'You're too fat anyway, Blue Boy,' to an indigo parrot fish that must have weighed a good ten pounds - his eyes were searching for only one of his 'people' - his only enemy on the reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpion fish.</p> <p>Scorpion fish inhabit most of the southern waters of the world, and the 'rascasse' that is the foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family. The West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve inches long and perhaps a pound in weight. It is by far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving warning. It is a mottled brownish grey with a heavy, wedge-shaped shaggy head. It has fleshy pendulous 'eyebrows' that droop over angry red eyes and a coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect camouflage on the reef. Though a small fish, its heavily toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles, are fed by poison glands containing enough tetrodotoxin to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable spot - in an artery, for instance, or over the heart or in the groin. They constitute the only real danger to the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than barracuda or shark, because, supremely confident in their camouflage and armoury, they flee before nothing except the very close approach of a foot or actual contact. Then they flit only a few yards on wide and bizarrely striped pectorals and settle again watchfully either on the sand, where they look like a lump of overgrown coral, or amongst the rocks and seaweed, where they virtually disappear. And Major Smythe was determined to find one, spear it and give it to his octopus to see if it would take or spurn it, see if one of the ocean's great predators would recognize the deadliness of another, know of its poison. Would the octopus consume the belly and leave the spines? Would it eat the lot and, if so, would it suffer from the poison? These were the questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered and today, since it was going to be the beginning of the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets and though it might mean the end of his darling Octopussy, Major Smythe had decided to find out the answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine biological files.</p> <p>For, only a couple of hours earlier, Major Dexter Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much for the worse. So much for the worse that he would be lucky if, in a few weeks' time - time for the sending of cables from Government House to the Colonial Office, to be relayed to the Secret Service and thence to Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major Smythe's transportation to London with a police escort - he got away with a sentence of imprisonment for life.</p> <p>And all this because of a man called Bond, Commander James Bond, who had turned up at ten thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.</p> <p>The day had started normally. Major Smythe had awoken from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him aspirin), showered and skimped his breakfast under the umbrella-shaped sea-almonds and spent an hour feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds. He then took his prescribed doses of anti-coagulant and blood-pressure pills and killed time with the Daily Gleaner until he could have his elevenses which, for months now, he had advanced to ten thirty. He had just poured himself the first of two stiff brandies and ginger ales, 'the drunkard's drink', when he heard the car coming up the drive.</p> <p>Luna, his coloured housekeeper, came out into the garden and announced, 'Gemmun to see you, Major.'</p> <p>'What's his name?'</p> <p>'Him doan say. Major. Him say to tell you him come from Govment House.'</p> <p>Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of old khaki shorts and sandals. He said, 'All right, Luna. Put him in the living room and say I won't be a moment,' and went round the back way into his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and trousers and brushed his hair. Government House! Now what the hell?</p> <p>As soon as he had walked through into the living-room and seen the tall man in the dark-blue tropical suit standing at the picture window looking out to sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news. Then, when the man had turned slowly to look at him with watchful, serious blue-grey eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical officialdom. A chill had run down Major Smythe's spine. 'They' had somehow found out.</p> <p>'Well, well. I'm Smythe. I gather you're from Government House. How's Sir Kenneth?'</p> <p>There was somehow no question of shaking hands. The man said, 'I haven't met him. I only arrived a couple of days ago. I've been out round the island most of the time. My name's Bond, James Bond. I'm from the Ministry of Defence.'</p> <p>Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism for the Secret Service. He said, with forced cheerfulness, 'Oh. The old firm?'</p> <p>The question had been ignored. 'Is there somewhere we can talk?'</p> <p>'Rather. Anywhere you like. Here or in the garden? What about a drink?' Major Smythe clinked the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.' Rum and ginger's the local poison. I prefer the ginger by itself. 'The lie came out with the automatic smoothness of the alcoholic.</p> <p>' No thanks. And here would be fine.' The man leaned 5negligently against the wide mahogany windowsill.</p> <p>Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters' chairs he had had copied from an original by the local cabinet-maker. He pulled out the drink coaster from the other 1arm, took a deep pull at his glass and slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the hole in the wood. 'Well,' he said cheerily, looking the other man straight in the eyes,'what can I do for you? Somebody been up to some dirty work on the North Shore and you need a spare hand?

The man had already got his cigarette case in his hand. It was a flat gun-metal one that would hold a round fifty. Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness comforted Major Smythe.</p> <p>'Of course, my dear fellow.' He made a move to get up, his lighter ready. 'It's all right, thanks.' James Bond had already lit his cigarette. 'No, it's nothing local. I want to, I've been sent out to ask you to recall your work for the Service at the end of the war.' James Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe carefully. 'Particularly the time when you were working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau.'</p> <p>Major Smythe laughed sharply. He had known it. He had known it for absolutely sure. But when it came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit man. 'Oh Lord, yes. Good old MOB. That was a lark all right.' He laughed again. He felt the anginal pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew was coming, build up across his chest. He dipped his hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle into the palm of his hand and slipped the white TNT pill under his tongue. He was amused to see the tension coil up in the other man, the way the eyes narrowed watchfully. It's all right, my dear fellow. This isn't a death pill. He said, 'You troubled with acidosis? No? It slays me when I go on a bender. Last night. Party at Jamaica Inn. One really ought to stop thinking one's always twenty-five. Anyway, let's get back to MOB Force. Not many of us left, I suppose.'

Handed them over without a murmur. Hoped that'd earn 'em easy treatment, I suppose. We gave the stuff a first going-over and shipped all the bods off to the Munich camp. Last I heard of them. Most of them hanged for war crimes, I expect. We handed the bumph over to HO. at Salzburg. Then we went on up the Mittersill valley after another hideout.' Major Smythe took a good pull at his drink and lit a cigarette. He looked up. 'That's the long and the short of it.'</p> <p>'You were Number 2 at the time, I think.

Far from front lines and prying eyes, Japanese doctors and their assistants subjected human guinea pigs to gruesome medical experiments in the name of science and Japan's wartime chemical and biological warfare research.<br><br>Author Hal Gold draws upon a wealth of sources to construct a portrait of the Imperial Japanese Army's most notorious medical unit, giving an overview of its history and detailing its most shocking activities. The book presents the words of former unit members themselves, taken from remarks they made at a traveling Unit 731 exhibition held in Japan in 1994-95. They recount vivid first-hand memories of what it was like to take part in horrific experiments on men, women and children, their motivations and reasons why they chose to speak about their actions all these years later.<br><br>A new foreword by historian Yuma Totani examines the actions of Unit 731, the post-war response by the Allies and the lasting importance of the book. <i>Japan's Infamous Unit 731</i> represents an essential addition to the growing body of literature on the still unfolding story of some of the most infamous war crimes in modem military history. By showing how the ethics of normal men and women, and even an entire profession, can be warped by the fire of war, this important book offers a window on a time of human madness and the hope that history will not be repeated.</p><p><b>Hal Gold</b> (1929-2009) was a writer, journalist and historian who was a resident of Kyoto for over 30 years.

Even stories about buried treasure are fictitious, he says, yet still the myth remains. Though pirate captains were often sadistic villains and crews endured barbarous tortures, were constantly threatened with the possibility of death by hanging, drowning in a storm, or surviving a shipwreck on a hostile coast, pirates are still idealized. Cordingly examines why the myth of the romance of piratehood endures and why so few lived out their days in luxury on the riches they had plundered.sing, revisionist history, the former head of exhibitions at England&#39;s National Maritime Museum has combed original documents and records to produce a most authoritative and definitive account of piracy&#39;s &#34;Golden Age.&#34; As he explodes many accepted myths (i.e. &#34;walking the plank&#34; is pure fiction), Cordingly replaces them with a truth that is more complex and often bloodier. 16 pp. of photos.

Using a cutting-edge technology called DHI--which stands for both Disney Host Interactive and Daylight Hologram Imaging--Finn Whitman, an Orlando teen, and four other kids are transformed into hologram projections that guide guests through the park. The new technology turns out, however, to have unexpected effects that are both thrilling and scary. Soon Finn finds himself transported in his DHI form into the Magic Kingdom at night. Is it real? Is he dreaming? Finn&#39;s confusion only increases when he encounters Wayne, an elderly Imagineer who tells him that the park is in grave danger. Led by the scheming witch, Maleficent, a mysterious group of characters called the Overtakers is plotting to destroy Disney&#39;s beloved realm, and maybe more. This gripping high-tech tale will thrill every kid who has ever dreamed of sneaking into Walt Disney World after hours and wondered what happens at night, when the park is closed.</p><p><br>Dave Barry is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of more than a dozen books, including <i>Dave Barry's History of the Millennium (So Far)</i>; <i>The Shepherd, the Angel, and Walter the Christmas Miracle Dog</i>; <i>Dave Barry's Money Secrets</i>; and <i>Big Trouble</i>.

Rides close unexpectedly, parade schedules change without notice, and costumes disappear. Are the animatronics coming alive after the park closes? Who are the Overtakers? Only Finn and his four friends can save the Magic Kingdom. Displaying an impressive range of kid voices, narrator Gary Littman lets Finn and company act like normal preteens, obnoxious, skeptical, jealous, goofy, and macho, in turns. As Wayne, their Imagineer-guide, his voice crackles with age, and his Robert Newton impression when the Pirates of the Caribbean try to shanghai Finn is super.

In so doing, Dr. Flowers&#x2019; sets out to help his readers understand a non-Calvinistic &#x201c;Traditional&#x201d; Southern Baptist interpretation of the most quoted and relied upon chapters for defending Calvinistic soteriology: Romans 8-9; Ephesians 1 and John 6. "In The Potter&#x2019;s Promise, Dr. Leighton Flowers reveals, by means of a refreshingly clear and persuasive writing style, the theological and philosophical arguments that compelled him to abandon his previously held Calvinistic convictions. While some Traditionalists have a tendency to avoid certain Bible verses, Dr. Flowers tackles them fearlessly, placing them in their proper context in a manner consistent with the entirety of God&#x2019;s Word. Calvinists have sometimes been known to object to Traditional writers and thinkers by making the claim, &#x201c;You just don&#x2019;t understand Calvinism.&#x201d; Any such charge leveled against Dr. Flowers rings hollow. Having heard all the arguments Calvinism has to offer, he nevertheless disaffirms it. Every Calvinist needs to read this book to challenge their thinking and consider the other side. Every Traditionalist needs to read this book to become better equipped in defending their own view of salvation doctrine." -Dr. Rick Patrick, Executive Director of Connect 316 and Senior Pastor&#x201c;Confused by the issues surrounding Calvinism? Does Romans 9 teach unconditional predestination? Want to cut through some of the red tape? Then read Leighton&#x2019;s book. He is charitable but gets right to the point, making a strong, biblical case for a God who is glorified by sacrificing Himself for creation and not by sacrificing creation for Himself. He makes a strong case for the God of Jesus Christ.&#x201d; - Austin Fischer, Pastor and Author of Young, Restless, No Longer Reformed.&#x201c;Some passages (especially Romans 9) appear to support Calvinism, but does God really predestine particular persons for heaven or hell? And where is the knowledgeable expositor who also possesses an irenic disposition to answer such critical questions? Leighton Flowers nobly meets these qualifications and approaches the Scripture with a passion for the original language and context. We are all deeply in his debt for teaching us to hear God's Word so much better than we did before this book was written. Highly recommended.&#x201d; -Dr. Malcolm B. Yarnell III, Research Professor of Systematic Theology, Author of God the Trinity: Biblical Portraits and Royal Priesthood in the English Reformation and The Formation of Christian Doctrine"The Potter&#x2019;s Promise is the fascinating pilgrimage of Leighton Flowers, Director of Apologetics and Youth Evangelism in the Baptist General Convention of Texas. Chronicled here is his journey out of Calvinism and into a New Testament faith through the saving grace of our Lord. This may well be the most important volume published this year for the reading of every young servant of Christ. Do you have the courage to read it?" &#x2013;Dr. Paige Patterson, President of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary&#x201c;Having vacated theological Geneva after years as one of its finest citizens, Dr. Leighton Flowers is well aware of how to reason like a Calvinist. His masterful treatment of the biblical text, and his philosophically consistent reasoning, is sure to satisfy the pallet of the academically interested. Yet, his accessible writing leads to a rare accomplishment. Lay readers will have no difficulty understanding the Calvinist positions and the best responses to them.

With the help of Sapo, "the meanest and ugliest kid on the block," Chino manages to make it as far as college before his life is endangered. He even attracts the attention of Nancy Saldivia, a beautiful Pentecostal girl so genuinely devout that she has earned the high school nickname "Blanca." In a typically vivid passage at the start of his debut novel, <i>Bodega Dreams</i>, Ernesto Qui�onez writes: <blockquote> Blanca wasn't allowed to wear jeans but she made up for it by wearing tight, short skirts. She always carried a Bible with her and never talked bad about anybody and at school she only hung around with her Pentecostal friend, Lucy. Lucy was a hairy girl who never shaved her legs because it was against her religion. Blanca had hairy legs as well, but Lucy's legs were so hairy that everyone called her Chewbacca.... When the cruelty toward Lucy became too much for Blanca, she'd punish the boys by being the coldest, most serious person in school. Only Blanca could get away with this because she had an angelic face that almost made you want to sing Alleluia. Made you want to pick up a tambourine and join her one night in her church. Make a joyful noise to the Lord so she would begin to jump up and down to all that religious salsa. And maybe you'd be lucky enough to cop a cheap feel as the Holy Ghost took over her body. </blockquote> Our narrator's luck is running out, though, and when Sapo introduces him to the mysterious, powerful Willie Bodega, Chino finds himself helplessly drawn into a criminal network. Even if Chino and Sapo's world is far from your own, you can't help but succumb to Qui�onez's funny, rapid-fire prose and his uncanny gift for dialect. The author's dead-on renderings of verbal tics and rhythms fit seamlessly into his depiction of the vibrant culture of East Harlem. <i>Bodega Dreams</i> is an unusually accomplished debut with all the right ingredients: distinctive characters, a troubling plot, and a seductive voice. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"A new and authentic voice of the urban Latino experience." --Esmeralda Santiago, author of When I Was Puerto Rican <br>In a stunning narrative combining the gritty rhythms of Junot Diaz with the noir genius of Walter Mosley, Bodega Dreams announces the arrival of a writer who "The Village Voice has already hailed as "a Writer on the Verge." <br>The word is out in Spanish Harlem: Willy Bodega is king. Need college tuition for your daughter? Start-up funds for your fruit stand? Bodega can help. He gives everyone a leg up, in exchange only for loyalty--and a steady income from the drugs he pushes. <br>Lyric, inspired, and darkly funny, this powerful debut novel brilliantly evokes the trial of Chino, a smart, promising young man to whom Bodega turns for a favor. Chino is drawn to Bodega's street-smart idealism, but soon finds himself over his head, navigating an underworld of switchblade tempers, turncoat morality, and murder.</p><h2>Jerry Thomas Bartenders Guide 1862 Reprint: How to Mix Drinks, or the Bon Vivant&#39;s Companion</h2><p><p>The 1862 Bartenders Guide is the FIRST cocktail book, in its FIRST version, now in an affordable reprint as it first appeared, in Hardback.</p> <p>It was first known as "How to Mix Drinks, or the Bon Vivant&#x2019;s Companion" and published in 1862 with "A Manual for the Manufacture of Cordials, Liquors, Fancy Syrups, etc, etc" by Christian Schultz appended at the back, since any good bartender was supposed to know how to both mix and make.<br> <br> It includes drinks that we still know today like the Mint Julep and lesser known drinks like Absinthe Water, Flip, and Fix.&nbsp; One can use it to impress your friends making the Balaklava Nectar, Locomotive, and Blue Blazer.<br> <br> Originals of the 1862 Jerry Thomas Bartender's Guide have been costing $2,000 in 2016, so enjoy this inexpensive reprint and spend your savings in studious enjoyment!</p></p><p>Jeremiah (Jerry) P. Thomas (1830-1885) was an American bartender; because of his pioneering work in popularizing cocktails across the United States, he is considered &#34;the father of American mixology.&#34; In addition to writing the seminal work on cocktails, his creativity and showmanship established the image of the bartender as a creative professional. As such, he was often nicknamed &#34;Professor&#34; Jerry Thomas. Thomas was born in 1830 in Sackets Harbor, New York. He learned bartending in New Haven, Connecticut before sailing for California during its mid-1800s Gold Rush. While in California he worked as a bartender, gold prospector and minstrel show manager. He moved back to New York City in 1851, where he opened a saloon below Barnum&#39;s American Museum; it would be the first of four saloons he would run in New York City over his lifetime. After a time running his first bar he went on the road for several years, working as the head bartender at hotels and saloons in St. Louis, Missouri, Chicago, Illinois, San Francisco, California, Charleston, South Carolina and New Orleans, Louisiana. At one point he toured Europe, carrying along a set of solid-silver bar tools. He was well known for his showmanship as a bartender: he developed elaborate and flashy techniques of mixing cocktails, sometimes while juggling bottles, cups and mixers. He often wore flashy jewelry and had bar tools and cups embellished with precious stones and metals. At the Occidental Hotel in San Francisco, Thomas was earning $100 a week-more than the Vice President of the United States. Upon returning to New York City, he became head bartender at the Metropolitan hotel before opening his most famous bar on Broadway, between 21st and 22nd Streets, in 1866. Thomas was one of the first to display the work of Thomas Nast, and in his famous saloon he hung caricatures of the political and theatrical figures; one notable drawing, now lost, was of Thomas &#34;in nine tippling postures colossally&#34;. He died in New York City of apoplexy in 1885 at the age of 55. His death was marked by substantial obituaries across the United States. In their obituary, The New York Times noted Thomas was &#34;at one time better known to club men and men about town than any other bartender in this city, and he was very popular among all classes.&#34;&#34;The Bartender Who Started It All&#34; (NY Times, October 2007)</p><h2>The Spy Who Loved Me (James Bond (Original Series))</h2><p><p>Set apart from the other books in Ian Fleming&#x2019;s James Bond series, <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> is told from the perspective of a femme fatale in the making&#x2013;&#x2013;a victim of circumstance with a wounded heart. </p><p>Vivienne Michel, a precocious French Canadian raised in the United Kingdom, seems a foreigner in every land.

He was educated at Eton College and later spent a formative period studying languages in Europe. His first job was with Reuters News Agency where a Moscow posting gave him firsthand experience with what would become his literary <i>bete noire</i>&#x2014;the Soviet Union. During World War II he served as Assistant to the Director of Naval Intelligence and played a key role in Allied espionage operations. <p>After the war he worked as foreign manager of the <i>Sunday Times</i>, a job that allowed him to spend two months each year in Jamaica. Here, in 1952, at his home &#x201c;Goldeneye,&#x201d; he wrote a book called <i>Casino Royale</i>&#x2014;and James Bond was born. The first print run sold out within a month. For the next twelve years Fleming produced a novel a year featuring Special Agent 007, the most famous spy of the century. His travels, interests, and wartime experience lent authority to everything he wrote. Raymond Chandler described him as &#x201c;the most forceful and driving writer of thrillers in England.&#x201d; Sales soared when President Kennedy named the fifth title, <i>From Russia With Love</i>, one of his favorite books.

SCAREDY CAT</p> <p>I was running away. I was running away from England, from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my London life had collected around me; and I was running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability, although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost everything except the law.</p> <p>And I had run a very long way indeed - almost, exaggerating a bit, halfway round the world. In fact, I had come all the way from London to The Dreamy Pines Motor Court which is ten miles west of Lake George, the famous American tourist resort in the Adirondacks - that vast expanse of mountains, lakes and pine forests which forms most of the northern territory of New York State. I had started on September 1st, and it was now Friday October 13th. When I had left, the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my square had been green, or as green as any tree can be in London in August. Now, in the billion-strong army of pine trees that marched away northwards towards the Canadian border, the real, wild maples flamed here and there like shrapnel-bursts. And I felt that I, or at any rate my skin, had changed just as much - from the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my London life to the snap and colour and sparkle of living out of doors and going to bed early and all those other dear dull things that had been part of my life in Quebec before it was decided that I must go to England and learn to be a 'lady'. Very unfashionable, of course, this cherry-ripe, strength-through-joy complexion, and I had even stopped using lipstick and nail varnish, but to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin and getting back into my own, and I was childishly happy and pleased with myself whenever I looked in the mirror (that's another thing - I'll never say 'looking-glass' again; I just don't have to any more) and found myself not wanting to paint a different face over my own. I'm not being smug about this. I was just running away from the person I'd been for the past five years. I wasn't particularly pleased with the person I was now, but I had hated and despised the other one, and I was glad to be rid of her face.</p> <p>Station WOKO (they might have dreamed up a grander call-sign!) in Albany, the capital of New York State and about fifty miles due south of where I was, announced that it was six o'clock. The weather report that followed included a storm warning with gale-force winds. The storm was moving down from the north and would hit Albany around 8pm. That meant that I would be having a noisy night. I didn't mind. Storms don't frighten me, and although the nearest living soul, as far as I knew, was ten miles away up the not very good secondary road to Lake George, the thought of the pines that would soon be thrashing outside, the thunder and lightning and rain, made me already feel snug and warm and protected in anticipation. And alone! But above all alone! 'Loneliness becomes a lover, solitude a darling sin.' Where had I read that? Who had written it? It was so exactly the way I felt, the way that, as a child, I had always felt until I had forced myself to 'get into the swim', 'be one of the crowd' -a good sort, on the ball, hep. And what a hash I had made of 'togetherness'! I shrugged the memory of failure away. Everyone doesn't have to live in a heap. Painters, writers, musicians are lonely people. So are statesmen and admirals and generals. But then, I added to be fair, so are criminals and lunatics. Let's just say, not to be too flattering, that true individuals are lonely. It's not a virtue, the reverse if anything. One ought to share and communicate if one is to be a useful member of the tribe. The fact that I was so much happier when I was alone was surely the sign of a faulty, a neurotic character. I had said this so often to myself in the past five years that now, that evening, I just shrugged my shoulders and, hugging my solitude to me, walked across the big lobby to the door and went out to have a last look at the evening.</p> <p>I hate pine trees. They are dark and stand very still and you can't shelter under them or climb them. They are very dirty, with a most un-treelike black dirt, and if you get this dirt mixed with their resin they make you really filthy. I find their jagged shapes vaguely inimical, and the way they mass so closely together gives me the impression of an army of spears barring my passage. The only good thing about them is their smell, and, when I can get hold of it, I use pine-needle essence in my bath. Here, in the Adirondacks, the endless vista of pine trees was positively sickening. They clothe every square yard of earth in the valleys and climb up to the top of every mountain so that the impression is of a spiky carpet spread to the horizon -an endless vista of rather stupid-looking green pyramids waiting to be cut down for matches and coat-hangers and copies of the New York Times.</p> <p>Five acres or so of these stupid trees had been cleared to build the motel, which is all that this place really was.' Motel' isn't a good word any longer. It has become smart to use 'Motor Court' or 'Ranch Cabins' ever since motels became associated with prostitution, gangsters and murders, for all of which their anonymity and lack of supervision is a convenience. The site, tourist-wise, in the lingo of the trade, was a good one. There was this wandering secondary road through the forest, which was a pleasant alternative route between Lake George and Glens Falls to the south, and halfway along it was a small lake, cutely called Dreamy Waters, that is a traditional favourite with picnickers. It was on the southern shore of this lake that the motel had been built, its reception lobby facing the road with, behind this main building, the rooms fanning out in a semi-circle. There were forty rooms with kitchen, shower and lavatory, and they all had some kind of a view of the lake behind them. The whole construction and design was the latest thing - glazed pitch-pine front-ages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles, air-conditioning, television in every cabin, children's playground, swimming pool, golf range out over the lake with floating balls (fifty balls, one dollar) - all the gimmicks. Food? Cafeteria in the lobby, and grocery and liquor deliveries twice a day from Lake George. All this for ten dollars single and sixteen double. No wonder that, with around two hundred thousand dollars' capital outlay and a season lasting only from July 1st to the beginning of October, or, so far as the NO VACANCY sign was concerned, from July 14th to Labour Day, the owners were finding the going hard. Or so those dreadful Phanceys had told me when they'd taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars a week plus keep. Thank heavens they were out of my hair! Song in my heart? There had been the whole heavenly choir at six o'clock that morning when their shiny station wagon had disappeared down the road on their way to Glens Falls and then to Troy where the monsters came from. Mr Phancey had made a last grab at me and I hadn't been quick enough. His free hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before I had crunched my heel into his instep. He had let go then. When his contorted face had cleared, he said softly, 'All right, sex-box. Just see that you mind camp good until the boss comes to take over the keys tomorrow midday. Happy dreams tonight.' Then he had grinned a grin I hadn't understood, and had gone over to the station-wagon where his wife had been watching from the driver's seat. 'Come on, Jed,' she had said sharply. 'You can work off those urges on West Street tonight.' She put the car in gear and called over to me sweetly, ' 'Bye now, cutie-pie. Write us every day.' Then she had wiped the crooked smile off her face and I caught a last glimpse of her withered, hatchet profile as the car turned out on to the road. Phew! What a couple! Right out of a book - and what a book! Dear Diary! Well, people couldn't come much worse, and now they'd gone. From now on, on my travels, the human race must improve!</p> <p>I had been standing there, looking down the way the Phanceys had gone, remembering them. Now I turned and looked to the north to see after the weather. It had been a beautiful day, Swiss clear and hot for the middle of October, but now high fretful clouds, black with jagged pink hair from the setting sun, were piling down the sky. Fast little winds were zigzagging among the forest tops and every now and then they hit the single yellow light above the deserted gas station down the road at the tail of the lake and set it swaying. When a longer gust reached me, cold and buffeting, it brought with it the whisper of a metallic squeak from the dancing light, and the first time this happened I shivered deliciously at the little ghostly noise. On the lake shore, beyond the last of the cabins, small waves were lapping fast against the stones and the gun-metal surface of the lake was fretted with sudden cats&#x2019; paws that sometimes showed a fleck of white. But, in between the angry gusts, the air was still, and the sentinel trees across the road and behind the motel seemed to be pressing silently closer to huddle round the camp-fire of the brightly-lit building at my back.</p> <p>I suddenly wanted to go to the loo, and I smiled to myself. It was the piercing tickle that comes to children during hide-and-seek-in-the dark and 'Sardines', when, in your cupboard under the stairs, you heard the soft creak of a floorboard, the approaching whisper of the searchers. Then you clutched yourself in thrilling anguish and squeezed your legs together and waited for the ecstasy of discovery, the crack of light from the opening door and then - the supreme moment - your urgent' Ssh! Come in with me!', the softly closing door and the giggling warm body pressed tight against your own.</p> <p>Standing there, a 'big girl' now, I remembered it all and recognised the sensual itch brought on by a...</p></p><h2>Americana: A 400-Year History of American Capitalism</h2><p><b>An absorbing and original narrative history of American capitalism<br><br>NAMED A BEST BOOK OF 2017 BY <i>THE ECONOMIST<br><br></i></b>From the days of the Mayflower and the Virginia Company, America has been a place for people to dream, invent, build, tinker, and bet the farm in pursuit of a better life. <i>Americana</i> takes us on a four-hundred-year journey of this spirit of innovation and ambition through a series of Next Big Things -- the inventions, techniques, and industries that drove American history forward: from the telegraph, the railroad, guns, radio, and banking to flight, suburbia, and sneakers, culminating with the Internet and mobile technology at the turn of the twenty-first century. The result is a thrilling alternative history of modern America that reframes events, trends, and people we thought we knew through the prism of the value that, for better or for worse, this nation holds dearest: capitalism.&nbsp;<br><br>In a winning, accessible style, Bhu Srinivasan boldly takes on four centuries of American enterprise, revealing the unexpected connections that link them. We learn how Andrew Carnegie's early job as a telegraph messenger boy paved the way for his leadership of the steel empire that would make him one of the nation's richest men; how the gunmaker Remington reinvented itself in the postwar years to sell typewriters; how the inner workings of the Mafia mirrored the trend of consolidation and regulation in more traditional business; and how a 1950s infrastructure bill triggered a series of events that produced one of America's most enduring brands: KFC. Reliving the heady early days of Silicon Valley, we are reminded that the start-up is an idea as old as America itself.<br><br>Entertaining, eye-opening, and sweeping in its reach, <i>Americana</i> is an exhilarating new work of narrative history.</p><p>Bhu Srinivasan is an accomplished media entrepreneur whose career has spanned digital media, pop culture, technology, publishing, and financial content.

He is one of the most well known and beloved literary writers of his generation, with works such as <em>The Long Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven </em>and <em>Reservation Blues</em> and has received numerous awards and citations, including the PEN/Malamud Award for Fiction and the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Award.<i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 7&#x2013;10&#x2014;Exploring Indian identity, both self and tribal, Alexie's first young adult novel is a semiautobiographical chronicle of Arnold Spirit, aka Junior, a Spokane Indian from Wellpinit, WA. The bright 14-year-old was born with water on the brain, is regularly the target of bullies, and loves to draw. He says, "I think the world is a series of broken dams and floods, and my cartoons are tiny little lifeboats." He expects disaster when he transfers from the reservation school to the rich, white school in Reardan, but soon finds himself making friends with both geeky and popular students and starting on the basketball team. Meeting his old classmates on the court, Junior grapples with questions about what constitutes one's community, identity, and tribe. The daily struggles of reservation life and the tragic deaths of the protagonist's grandmother, dog, and older sister would be all but unbearable without the humor and resilience of spirit with which Junior faces the world. The many characters, on and off the rez, with whom he has dealings are portrayed with compassion and verve, particularly the adults in his extended family. Forney's simple pencil cartoons fit perfectly within the story and reflect the burgeoning artist within Junior. Reluctant readers can even skim the pictures and construct their own story based exclusively on Forney's illustrations. The teen's determination to both improve himself and overcome poverty, despite the handicaps of birth, circumstances, and race, delivers a positive message in a low-key manner. Alexie's tale of self-discovery is a first purchase for all libraries.&#x2014;<i>Chris Shoemaker, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ryle was well known for his warm, plain-spoken candor, the kind which appeals to all souls regardless of rank or title, and this booklet is no different. Bold, encouraging, and affectionate, A Call to Prayer is just as the title says&#x2014;an earnest invitation for all children of God to come before Him in prayer. Read it, be edified, and have hope: you have access to the Maker of heaven and earth who can do all things.</p><p>John Charles Ryle (1816-1900) was the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool. Ryle was born at Macclesfield, and was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was Craven Scholar in 1836. After holding a curacy at Exbury in Hampshire, he became rector of St Thomas&#39;s, Winchester (1843), rector of Helmingham, Suffolk (1844), vicar of Stradbroke (1861), honorary canon of Norwich (1872), and dean of Salisbury (1880). However before taking the latter office, he was advanced to the new see of Liverpool, where he remained until his resignation, which took place three months before his death at Lowestoft. His appointment to Liverpool was at the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856 69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was an athlete who rowed and played Cricket for Oxford, where he took a first class degree in Greats and was offered a college fellowship (teaching position) which he declined. The son of a wealthy banker, he was destined for a career in politics before choosing a path of ordained ministry. While hearing Ephesians 2 read in church in 1838, he felt a spiritual awakening and was ordained by Bishop Sumner at Winchester in 1842. For 38 years he was a parish vicar, first at Helmingham and later at Stradbrooke, in Suffolk. He became a leader of the evangelical party in the Church of England and was noted for his doctrinal essays and polemical writings. In 1880, at age 64, he became the first bishop of Liverpool, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. He retired in 1900 at age 83 and died later the same year. He is buried in the All Saints&#39; Church, Childwall, Liverpool. In his diocese, he formed a clergy pension fund for his diocese and built over forty churches. Controversially, he emphasized raising clergy salaries ahead of building a cathedral for his new diocese. Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community.</p><h2>The Parable Series: The Pine Tree Parable</h2><p><p>The Pine Tree Parable tells the heartwarming tale of a farmer and his family who nurture tiny seedlings into fragrant Christmas trees.</p><p>When the trees are tall enough to offer to their neighbors, the farmer's wife plans to keep the most beautiful pine tree for her family, until one snowy December night when a child teaches her the true meaning of Christmas.</p></p><p><p>Liz Curtis Higgs&nbsp;is an award-winning speaker as well as the author of twenty-eight books, including&nbsp;<em>Bad Girls of the Bible&nbsp;</em>and <em>Thorn in My Heart</em>.&nbsp; Her Parable Series for children has been awarded the ECPA Gold Medallion for Excellence.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Treating Your OCD with Exposure and Response (Ritual) Prevention Therapy: Workbook (Treatments That Work)</h2><p>An estimated 2-3% of the population is affected by obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is a chronic condition that significantly affects daily functioning and quality of life. Many people with OCD would greatly benefit from receiving professional help to learn how to successfully manage this debilitating condition. This workbook aims to guide patients of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in how to best benefit from the treatment provided by their therapists. Treatments addressed in this publication include exposure and ritual (response) prevention, an effective, evidence-based treatment for this disorder.<br><br>Designed to be used in conjunction with its companion therapist guide titled<em> Exposure and Ritual (Response) Prevention for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder</em>, this<em> </em>Workbook includes an exposure and ritual prevention treatment program which is broken down into 17 - 20 biweekly treatment sessions. During these sessions the patient will be gradually exposed to situations and places that trigger his or her OCD symptoms. The goal is that over time the OCD sufferer comes to realize that the things he or she fears will not necessarily occur if the rituals are not performed. Some exposures will be supervised by the therapist, but the workbook can help the patient to practice on their own at home in order to overcome some of the barriers and difficulties that are part and parcel of every treatment.<br></p><p><br><strong>Elna Yadin, Ph.D. </strong>is a psychologist and Director of the OCD Clinic, Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety (CTSA), University of Pennsylvania. <br><br><strong>Edna B.

With the help of more than eighty color photographs we see the chefs at work in home kitchens and we learn the individual techniques that make their signature dishes so delicious -- and so workable. For example:<br>-- from Charles Palmer (Aureole, New York), how to sear peppery venison steaks<br>-- from Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger (Border Grill, Santa Monica), how to make a spicy vegetarian feast<br>-- from Emeril Lagasse (Emeril's, New Orleans), how to produce an authentic crab boil and a shrimp etoufee<br>-- from Andre Soltner (Lutece, New York), how to cook traditional family dishes from Alsace<br>-- from Jeremiah Tower (Stars, San Francisco), three innovative ways with chicken<br>-- from Lidia Bastianich (Felidia, New York), the secrets of pasta and risotto<br>-- from Patrick Clark (Hay-Adams Hotel, Washington, D.C.), new ways with fish -- fresh salmon as a roulade, grouper crusty with horseradish<br>-- from Michel Richard (Citrus, Los Angeles), how to work with chocolate -- a mousse-filled dome, deep-fried chocolate truffles<br>-- from Amy Ferguson-Ota (The Ritz-Carlton, Hawaii), the special flavors of island produce -- breadfruit, ti leaves, green papayas, wok-seared ono<br>-- from Robert Del Grande (Cafe Annie, Houston), how to cook with chiles<br>-- from Nancy Silverton (Campanile, Los Angeles), the trick of a grape starter that works magic on her crusty loaves<br>-- from Jan Birnbaum (Campton Place, San Francisco), how to home-smoke salmon and roast sassafras-encrusted lamb<br>-- from Jean-Louis Palladin (Jean-Louis at The Watergate, Washington, D.C.), the technique of roasting duck breasts in a fireplace<br>-- from Alice Waters (Chez Panisse, Berkeley), celebrating the winter harvest in vegetable dishes and salads<br>-- from Jacques Pepin (chef-at-large), making puff pastry and a freestanding souffle<br><br>Julia Child writes in her Introduction that she's never known a serious cook or chef who didn't say: "Every day I learn something new!" "That point of view," she says, "turns home cooking and the pleasures of the table into a wonderful adventure.' So, appetit, and enjoy the adventures that this wonderful book provides.</p><p>A companion to the PBS series of the same name, Julia Child's classic <i> Cooking with Master Chefs</i> introduces readers to sixteen of America's top chefs, then presents their signature dishes to make at home. With the relaxed precision cooks expect of Child's recipes, and aided by more than 80 color photos, the dishes are as accessible as they are delicious. Child's fans, as well as those of chefs including Emeril Lagasse (Emeril's, New Orleans), Andr� Soltner (formerly of Lut�ce, New York), Alice Waters (Chez Panisse, Berkeley) and Michel Richard (Citrus, Los Angeles), among others, will be delighted.<p> The recipes, arranged in mini-menus of three to five dishes each, run the gamut of (mostly) American-inspired specialties. The aforementioned Lagasse provides an authentic Louisiana Crab Broil and savory Shrimp &amp;Eacutetouf�e; Mary Sue Milligan and Susan Feninger (Border Grill, Santa Monica), present a spicy vegetarian feast; and Charles Palmer (Auriole, New York), reveals his methods for making perfectly seared Venison and Tender Butternut Squash Timbales. The Italian table is represented by Lidia Bastianich (Felidia, New York), who shares her Pasta Ears with Brocolli di Rape and Sausages. And for dessert, chef Richard produces an extraordinary Chocolate Dome and pulse-quickening Hot Chocolate Truffles. Other chefs provide equally mouth-watering dishes.</p><p> Useful notes on techniques and ingredients are given throughout and in an appendix. As lively as it is instructive, <i>Cooking with Master Chefs</i> should provide a gratifying encounter with a remarkable culinary crew, conducted by an esteemed interpreter of the world's table. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>This handsomely designed book, a companion to the new PBS television series, brings acclaimed chefs out of the restaurant and into their own home kitchens with characteristic dishes and singular stylishness. And as Child ( The Way to Cook ) observes, though readers may not be equipped to mimic these achievements exactly, we can indeed "gather ideas" from the recipes and apply them as we're able, with the aid and inspiration of 80 photographs. The lineup is brilliant, including Jacques Pepin, Alice Waters, Patrick Clark, Andre Soltner and 12 others; and it covers as much geographic as gastronomic ground, from Hawaii (one recipe by chef Amy Ferguson-Ota incorporates "ti" leaves, which grow wild there) to New Orleans. Reading soon enough becomes a form of voyeurism, possibly even better than dining, particularly when one turns to a Provencal tapenade, courtesy of Chez Panisse's proprietor, or to Michel Richard's "Chocolate Dome" with raspberry sauce. And of course, coming from Child, the book is well and warmly written.

Led by Lieutenant Colonel, and later Arizona governor, John R. Baylor and General H. H. Sibley, Texan soldiers trekked from San Antonio to Fort Bliss in El Paso, then northward up the Rio Grande, to Santa Fe. Fighting both Apaches and Federal troops, the half-trained, undisciplined army met success at the Battle of Val Verde and defeat at the Battle of Apache Canyon. Finally, the Texans won the Battle of Glorieta Pass, only to lose their supply train - and eventually the campaign. Pursued and demoralized, the Confederates abandoned their dream of empire and began a dispirited journey back to El Paso and San Antonio.<br>Using narratives of veterans of the campaign and official Confederate and Union documents, the author explains how this seemingly far-fetched fantasy of building a Confederate empire was an essential part of the Confederate strategy. Military historians will be challenged to modify traditional views of Confederate imperial ambitions. Generalists will be drawn into the fascinating saga of the soldiers' fears, despair, and struggles to survive.</p><p>Donald S. Frazier is assistant professor of history at McMurry University in Abilene, Texas."Frazier convincingly demonstrates that Union commander Edward R. S. Canby deserves more respect than he sometimes gets from historians for his part in driving Confederate armies out of New Mexico and Arizona. He also shows how Confederate General Henry Hopkins Sibley and Confederate Colonel John Robert Baylor--the two expansionist dreamers most responsible for the Confederacy's southwestern initiatives--had personal flaws which sabotaged the very territorial gains which they accomplished. His manuscript is sensitive to Confederate relations with Hispanics, and integrates Confederate campaigns against Apache tribes into his Civil War story. Many readers will appreciate Frazier's meticulous descriptions of camp life, soldiering in the arid Southwest, the battles of Val Verde, Apache Canyon, Glorieta and Peralta, and especially the backgrounds, motives, and personalities of the officers and soldiers involved in the Confederate campaigns for empire. One could not ask for a more engaging treatment from the Confederate perspective of the Civil War in the Southwest.&#x201d;--Robert E.

They traveled from Newfoundland to Florida, deep into the heart of Mexico, through the Southwest, the Pacific Northwest, and into Alaska's Pribilof Islands. Two years later, <i>Wild America</i>, their classic account of the trip, was published. </p><p>On the eve of that book's fiftieth anniversary, naturalist Scott Weidensaul retraces Peterson and Fisher's steps to tell the story of wild America today. How has the continent's natural landscape changed over the past fifty years? How have the wildlife, the rivers, and the rugged, untouched terrain fared? The journey takes Weidensaul to the coastal communities of Newfoundland, where he examines the devastating impact of the Atlantic cod fishery's collapse on the ecosystem; to Florida, where he charts the virtual extinction of the great wading bird colonies that Peterson and Fisher once documented; to the Mexican tropics of Xilitla, which have become a growing center of ecotourism since Fisher and Peterson's exposition. And perhaps most surprising of all, Weidensaul finds that much of what Peterson and Fisher discovered remains untouched by the industrial developments of the last fifty years. Poised to become a classic in its own right, <i>Return to Wild America</i> is a sweeping survey of the natural soul of North America today.</p></p><p><p><b>Scott Weidensaul </b>is the author of <i>The Ghost with Trembling Wings</i> (NPP, 2002) and <i>Living on the Wind (</i>NPP, 1999). He lives in the Pennsylvania Appalachians.</p>ONE <br> <br>Atlantic Gateway <br> <br>In the early 1950s, just getting to Cape St. Mary's was an adventure. The Avalon Peninsula is the easternmost prow of North America--a vaguely H-shaped chunk of land that is very nearly an island itself, attached to the rest of Newfoundland by the slenderest of threads. It is rimmed by sheer cliffs, by beaches of dark quartz-shot cobblestones and wave-smashed capes. Where there is forest, it is somber and mossy, spruce and balsam fir hung with long pale sheets of lichen dangling from the branches like rotting curtains. But much of the Avalon is tundra, known locally as barrens--an open, windswept land home to flocks of ptarmigan and the southernmost wild caribou herd in the world, where the trees, if they grow at all, cower in dense, waist-high thickets known as tuckamore. <br> <br>When Fisher and Peterson met here to begin their journey, Newfoundland was very much a world apart, sparsely populated and isolated from the rest of the country not only geographically but also politically; it had confederated with Canada only four years earlier, ending its long history as a separate dominion of Great Britain. Most of the people lived in remote fishing villages called outports accessible only by sea, and beyond the handful of large towns like St. John's the few roads were largely dirt and gravel, and at times all but disappeared into the spruce bogs. <br> <br>Accompanied by the local ornithologist Leslie Tuck, the two travelers spent a long day bouncing south from St. John's on awful roads. Fisher, keyed up to see new birds, found himself "seeking the differences and finding the similarities"; the first North American species he saw was a gannet, which was also the last British species he'd seen as his plane crossed the Scottish coast. This isn't surprising; few places in North America have as strong an Old World flavor, at least in terms of natural diversity, as Newfoundland. The landscape, Fisher thought, was strikingly similar to the spruce forests he'd known in Sweden, and of the forty-six species of birds they saw, almost two-thirds were ones he knew from Europe. He was stunned to find that the most common birdsong in the dark conifer woods was "a voice as familiar to me in my own English garden as on the cliffs of St. Kilda and the remote Shetland Islands"--that of the tiny winter wren. Though a common backyard bird in Great Britain, in North America it inhabits only the boreal forests of the North or high elevations. <br> <br>They spent the night in the fishing hamlet of St. Bride's, where the navigable road ended, and the next day--with a local guide and a pony to carry Peterson's heavy camera gear--they set off for the great seabird colony near the Cape St. Mary's lighthouse, ten miles down the coast. The special attraction would be thousands of northern gannets, majestic seabirds with six-foot wingspans and an extraordinary means of fishing in which they plunge, like white lances, straight down from more than a hundred feet in the air, hitting the water like Olympic high divers to intercept fish far beneath the surface. Fisher was perhaps the world's leading authority on gannets, and he was anxious to see them on this side of the Atlantic. <br> <br>"The most spectacular New World [gannet] colony, the one at Bonaventure Island off the Gasp�, is visited by scores of bird students every year," Peterson noted. "It has become a profitable thing for the innkeeper to cater to--and even advertise to--an unending succession of summer gannet watchers&#x2026;On the other hand, the colony at Cape St. Mary['s] sometimes goes for several years unvisited by any of the field-glass fraternity." It was easy to see why. The exhausting hike, first along a muddy, rutted cart track, and then overland around treacherous bogs, took them until early afternoon, and they didn't make it back to St. Bride's until well after midnight, Peterson limping from a badly strained leg muscle. <br> <br>It's a safe bet that Peterson and Fisher would find Cape St. Mary's today a strange, perhaps disquieting blend of the familiar and the unfamiliar. I flew into St. John's with my fianc�e, Amy Bourque, who was taking some time off from the Audubon sanctuary she ran in Maryland to get me started on my way and would join me at a couple of other points in the year ahead. Our drive from St. John's to St. Bride's took a couple of easy hours in a rental car, with just one stretch of gravel track that skirted bogs bounded by stands of pink rhodora azaleas. It was a cold day in the middle of June; the sedges and irises made an emerald splash along the coffee-colored rivers, where a few blackish spruce grew, but higher up, the still-brown tundra rolled inland beyond the limit of vision, empty of any sign of humanity. <br> <br>The reason for this little slice of the Arctic, at the same latitude as Montreal and Seattle, is the ocean. Pack ice surrounds much of the Avalon Peninsula until April or May, and throughout the summer icebergs that originated in Greenland are a common sight, floating south on the Labrador Current. Especially along the immediate coastline, summer fogs are an almost daily event, bathing the land in damp cold that counteracts the wan heat of the sun. This creates an ecosystem known as hyperoceanic barrens--a nearly horizontal plant community dominated by ground-hugging Arctic species like crowberry, several species of cranberries, hardy grasses, and pale reindeer lichen in spongy green-white mats, into which a hiker sinks ankle-deep. Dwarf Arctic willows, with trunks barely as thick as a finger, spread over rocks like a green cascade, raising maroon flowers five or six inches above the ground, their diminutive stature masking the fact that these trees are often three or four hundred years old, as deserving of awe as any craggy old-growth pine. <br> <br>From the air, the center of the Avalon Peninsula, and its southern capes in particular, appear pale brown, edged with black; the brown is the tundra barrens, while the darker rim is the spruce woods, which cling to the lower elevations and deeper river valleys. We spent part of one day hiking along some of the rivers that cut across the barrens, providing a convenient pathway in the otherwise featureless landscape. The only green was down along the water, where thick grass and irises were sprouting, but when we looked closely, the tundra was coming into great flower as well. <br> <br>To my eye it all looks like classic Arctic tundra, but there are enough floral differences that a botanist would immediately peg this as Newfoundland barrens: a spongy, wet mat of sphagnum moss and crowberry studded with pitcher plant, the diminutive white flowers of goldthread, and the pink of pale laurel, barely an inch high. Cloudberry, Newfoundland's famous "bake-apple," was just opening its single white flowers that would, by August, produce the delicious clear orange raspberries that are a provincial obsession. Much of the ground was covered in creeping juniper or, where there was a bit more shelter, patches of spruce tuckamore that were barely waist-high but might be four or five hundred years old. <br> <br>We were watching for caribou, and there was plenty of sign--a lot of droppings, some quite fresh, and tracks in the mud, each print slightly wasp-waisted in the middle. We also found the remains of a calf that had died over the winter, down along the stream--a corona of white hair and the clean, bleached bones, along the stream--a corona of white hair and the clean, bleached bones, along with piles and piles of mammal scat, much of it fox, all of it containing great quantities of caribou fur. When we later saw a live caribou, a large bull, it was albescent, as white as the weathered bones; even its nose was pale gray, so that the only color was the dark eyes and the black hair that grew inside its ears. <br> <br>The wind howled, and for five minutes a cold, heavy downpour soaked us before the sun peeked back out apologetically. We hiked an hour or so down the main river, then looped back and struck a smaller tributary, which had cut a confused series of low gorges in the rock--a creek maybe thirty feet wide, the water so stained with tannin it was nearly black. It was fed by a series of small pools and ponds on the higher ground to either side; some of these were jewel-like, surrounded by sedges and irises, set in little steep-sided dells where the wind couldn't reach and the dark water reflected the sky like glass. In one, a yellow-rumped warbler alit on a rocky shelf above the water, blue-gray against the yellow lichen, flew down to splash with its reflection, then whirled off with a single chip. <br> <br>More than a thousand square kilometers of the central Avalon are protected as a wilderness reserve, but even the margins are largely wild, largely wild, largely empty land. The only paved road is a loop that skirts the edge of the sea, linking the small towns like St. Shott's and Trepassey, with a handful of dirt tracks like the one that runs down to the old lighthouse at Cape Race, where we were paced by swift-flying horned larks and found the remains of a freshly killed murre on a low bluff beside the sea, its feathers gently waving in a long plume to the leeward where a peregrine falcon had sat and plucked it. Its skeleton was still wet and bloody, the two black wings untouched, but the falcon was gone. <br> <br></p><h2>Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power</h2><p>This special tenth-anniversary edition of Fools Crow: Wisdom and Power contains a remembrance of Fools Crow by Russell Means; an 8-page black and white photo insert; and a new afterword by the author, Thomas E.

Mr. Wilson reinterprets the knowledge of these insects through the concepts of modern biology, from biochemistry to evolutionary theory and population ecology. </p></p><p><b>Edward O. Wilson</b> is Pellegrino University Professor, Emeritus, at Harvard University. In addition to two Pulitzer Prizes (one of which he shares with Bert H�lldobler), Wilson has won many scientific awards, including the National Medal of Science and the Crafoord Prize of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.In comprehensiveness of scope and modernity of outlook <i>The Insect Societies</i> can truly be said to be unique. For many years to come it will surely constitute a benchmark for all those, professional and amateur alike, for whom the social insects offer one of the most compelling and fascinating pageants in all the world of nature. The book is likely to become a collector's item. (Caryl F. Haskins <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><i>The Insect Societies</i> gives an extraordinarily complete and up-to-date account of the natural history of social insects with their great proliferation of genera, species, and behavioral types...In these fields modern genetics, selection theory, and biomathematics are being developed to explain the evolution of insect societies and their diversity both in size and in longevity. This is one of the growing points in the study of social insects and an undertaking to which Wilson is making important contributions. (O. W. Richards <i>Science</i>)<br><br>No book on biology in the past 20 years has been as satisfying as this treatise on ants, bees, wasps and termites...It is written with clarity and verve, but what distinguishes it particularly is its catholic mastery of all of biology, from paleontology to formal genetics, from ethology to biochemistry. Nothing less can be an adequate basis for the study of our social colleagues on this earth, and nothing less has its courageous and energetic author settled for. Biology is a whole science, and here it is wholly seen...It is so honest and yet so rich that it attracts and holds by the scent of understanding. (<i>Scientific American</i>)<br><br>The book is well illustrated, and written in a clear direct style, with such specialist technical terms as Wilson feels obliged to uses explained in a glossary; evidently he is anxious to reach a wider audience than that provided by professional entomologists--as indeed the book deserves to do...This handsome book will undoubtedly be widely read and influential. (R. A. Crowson <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>Because ants, wasps, bees, and termites are of importance to man, because of their ecological domination of the land, and because their activities remind man of his own, this encyclopedic work will attract the general reader, students, and biologists as well as entomologists...This comprehensive work must be recognized as an outstanding contribution to biological literature. (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>If only because of the rarity of the event and the stature of the author...<i>The Insect Societies</i> must be considered a work of major importance. It is certain to influence the focus of research as well as the content of public information on the social insects for years to come...For anyone, layman or specialists, interested in a single, concise, lucid, and authoritative account of the most significant facts and theories about insect societies, <i>The Insect Societies</i> is the best available and will be for many years.

This remarkable anthology includes entries from more than 170 diarists and is the most wide-ranging and comprehensive ever compiled. Ten years in the making, The Assassin&#39;s Cloak pays tribute to a fascinating genre that is at once the most intimate and public of all literary forms. The scope of The Assassin&#39;s Cloak is peerless and international, and appropriately it begins with Samuel Pepys, the Shakespeare of all diarists. It reaches across the centuries with several diary excerpts for every day of the year and along the way we meet cads and charmers, sailors and psychopaths, rock stars and prima ballerinas, gossips, drunks, snobs, lechers, and lovers. There is humor and tragedy, history and the humdrum, often recorded on the same day or in the same entry. The diarists are likewise diverse, including John Steinbeck, Leo Tolstoy, Sylvia Plath, Andy Warhol, Franz Kafka, Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Anne Frank, Joseph Goebbels, Che Guevara, Dawn Powell, and Queen Victoria. Imprinted on the minds of the editors were the words of &#34;Chips&#34; Channon, one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest diarists. &#34;What is more dull than a discreet diary?&#34; he asked, before supplying his own answer: &#34;One might as well have a discreet soul.&#34; &#34;[S]wirling interlacing of then and now, past and present only adds to this magnificent anthology&#39;s appealing truth to life&#39;s richness.&#34; -- Michael Dirda, The Washington Post &#34;Wonderful entries ... this book is for the expert and the dilettante, for the coffee table and the reference shelf.&#34; -- Publishers Weekly &#34;The content is sensational-for all the right reasons. It is stimulating and charming in equal measure....&#34; -- Literary Review &#34;Utterly compulsive.... Its cumulative effect is surprisingly moving.&#34; -- The Times (London)</p><p><b>An Anthology of the World's Greatest Diarists</b><p>'A wonderfully entertaining anthology of diaries'<br><i>Mail on Sunday</i></p><p>'The perfect bedtime book'<br><i>Evening Standard</i></p><p>'Here are the great, the good, the bad, the hubristic and the humble'<br><i>The Times</i></p><p>'A diary is an assassin's cloak which we wear when we stab a comrade in the back with a pen.' So wrote William Soutar in 1934. But a diary is also a place for recording everyday thoughts and special occasions, private fears and hopeful dreams. As a result, this wonderful collection of entries from the world's greatest diarists is as inspiring as it is enlightening.</p></p><h2>The Art of Arranging Flowers: A Complete Guide to Japanese Ikebana</h2><p>The growing appreciation of Japanese Art and architecture in the West has extended to the Japanese way with flowers. This book is intended as a complete introduction to Ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement. Beginning with the history and development of the art, and its place in Japanese culture, we introduce the reader to the eleven basic styles. Next comes a large section devoted to vases, materials, tools, and methods. Text and pictures explain how to keep flowers fresh, how to select and prepare both fresh and dried materials, and how to make the most effective use of them. Twelve lessons in creating arrangements in the moibana style follow. I have tried to make this the most carefully detailed and profusely illustrated guide of its kind, enabling the reder to create many beautiful arrangements while learning all the necessary techniques of the art. Finally, there is a section devoted to advanced techniques and designs, both classic and modern, and to the setting of mood. Appedixes suggest ways to keep cut flowers fresh, tell how to make effective arrangements from one&#39;s own garden flowers and what plant materials to combine, and describe the symbolism of plants and their enhancement. I hope the reader will find this book enjoyable to read, easy to understand, and fun to follow.</p><p></p><h2>Spring Fever: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>First husbands</b><br> Annajane truly believes she is over her ex-husband, Mason.

Miss Pauline, for whom Pokey had been named, seldom spoke, but she was content to sit in church on Sunday mornings and smile and nod to the hymns, dabbing at her cataract-clouded blue eyes with her ever-present handkerchief and patting Annajane&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;She thinks you&#x2019;re me,&#x201d; Pokey would whisper, giggling at her grandmother&#x2019;s confusion and grimacing and holding her nose when Miss Pauline passed gas, which she did frequently.<br>When the &#x201c;new&#x201d; Church of the Good Shepherd was built in the early &#x2019;90s, with reproduction Tiffany stained-glass windows, solid cherry pews, and a custom-built German pipe organ, the old church was renamed the Woodrow Memorial Chapel in memory of Pauline Woodrow, who died in her sleep the year Pokey and Annajane turned fourteen.<br>Annajane&#x2019;s own wedding had been held in the chapel, the one concession her new in-laws made to what they considered Annajane&#x2019;s &#x201c;quaint&#x201d; ideas. Since she&#x2019;d paid for the wedding herself, she&#x2019;d insisted on having an intimate affair, just family and close friends, fewer than forty people, with Pokey as her only attendant. It had rained the November evening of her nuptials, and at the time she&#x2019;d considered it wildly romantic that the loud thrum of the rain on the church&#x2019;s tin roof threatened to drown out the wedding march played on the chapel&#x2019;s original wheezy pump organ.<br>Had it been only seven years ago? Sometimes she wasn&#x2019;t sure any of it had really happened at all, that it wasn&#x2019;t something she&#x2019;d just remembered from a long-ago dream.<br>Today&#x2019;s affair was nothing like Annajane&#x2019;s modest wedding. The sanctuary was at capacity&#x2014;beyond capacity, if you went by the county fire code, which said the church could hold five hundred people. It seemed to Annajane that every living person who had ever known or done business with the Bayless family, or even just sipped a bottle of their Quixie cherry soft drink, had crammed themselves into one of the polished wooden pews beneath the soaring exposed rafters of the imposing Episcopal church.<br>Annajane felt her eyelids droop now. It was too warm in the church, and the scent of the lilies and roses banking everything that didn&#x2019;t move was overpowering. She&#x2019;d had almost no sleep the night before, and not much more sleep the night before that. And, yes, she&#x2019;d had herself a good stiff drink, Quixie and bourbon on the rocks, back at the house, after she&#x2019;d finished dressing and before she&#x2019;d left for the church. She closed her eyes, just for a moment, felt her chin droop to her chest, and the next moment, she felt a sharp elbow dig into her ribs.<br>Pokey had managed to wedge herself into the pew. &#x201c;Wake up and slide over!&#x201d; she ordered.<br>Annajane&#x2019;s eyes flew open, and she looked up, just in time to see Sallie Bayless, seated in the front row, two pews ahead of them, turn and shoot Pokey a stern look of warning. Sallie&#x2019;s gleaming auburn hair shone in the candlelit church. She was sixty-four, but still had the dewy complexion, sparkling brown eyes, and slender figure of a woman twenty years younger. Now, those eyes narrowed as they took in Pokey&#x2019;s tardy and disheveled appearance.<br>Pokey gave her mother a grin and a finger wave, and Sallie&#x2019;s head swiveled back around, eyes front, head held high, the Bayless pearls, a double strand, clasped firmly around her neck.<br>Annajane offered an apologetic smile to the elderly woman to her right. The woman frowned, but begrudgingly inched aside to allow the new arrival to be seated.<br>As usual, Pokey Bayless Riggs took no notice of the stir she&#x2019;d caused. She&#x2019;d been causing a stir nearly every day of her thirty-five years, and today, her brother&#x2019;s wedding day, was no different.<br>The boatneck collar of Pokey&#x2019;s expensive new red silk jacket had slipped off her right shoulder, exposing a leopard-print bra strap and an unseemly amount of cleavage. Little Clayton was two years old, but Pokey was still struggling to lose her baby weight. She&#x2019;d managed to pop one of the jacket&#x2019;s rhinestone buttons, and the tight silk skirt had somehow twisted around so that the zipper was now in the front, rather than on the side. She was bare-legged, which was a scandal in and of itself, but now Annajane noticed that her best friend had ditched the Sallie-mandated sedate dyed-silk slingback pumps in favor of a pair of blinged-out silver flip flops.<br>Pokey&#x2019;s thin, poker-straight blond hair had already lost its beauty-salon bounce, and now hung limply on either side of her full pink cheeks. Her lipstick was smeared. But her eyes, her amazing cornflower-blue eyes, glinted with mischief.<br>&#x201c;Busted!&#x201d; Annajane whispered, not daring to look at her best friend.<br>&#x201c;Christ!&#x201d; Pokey muttered. &#x201c;This is so not my fault. I couldn&#x2019;t find a parking spot! The church lot&#x2019;s full and the whole block is lined with cars on both sides of the street. I had to leave the Land Rover clear down the block in front of the gas station and run all the way here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to be up there with your mom and everybody else in the family?&#x201d; Annajane asked. &#x201c;I mean, you <i>are</i> the groom&#x2019;s only sister.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Screw that,&#x201d; Pokey said swiftly. &#x201c;I refuse to make nice with that woman. Mason knows I don&#x2019;t like her. Mama knows it too. I&#x2019;m taking a moral stand here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Who the hell are all these people anyway?&#x201d; she asked, glancing around at the packed church and zeroing in on the bride&#x2019;s side of the aisle. &#x201c;Not family, right? Since poor lil&#x2019; Celia is an orphan, and the only family she could produce is that elderly great aunt staying over at Mama&#x2019;s house. Did Celia charter a bus or something?&#x201d;<br>Annajane shrugged. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re apparently the only person in Passcoe who <i>doesn&#x2019;t</i> think that Celia Wakefield is the best thing since flush toilets and sliced store-bought bread.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me that. You hate her as much as I do,&#x201d; Pokey said under her breath.<br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Annajane replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m happy for them.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yippy-fuckin&#x2019;-skippy,&#x201d; Pokey drawled. &#x201c;Happy, happy, happy. It&#x2019;s fine for you. In less than a week, you&#x2019;ll pack up your U-Haul and head for Atlanta and your nice new life without even a glance in the rearview mirror. New man, new job, new address. But where does that leave me? Stuck here in stinkin&#x2019; Passcoe, with my mama, my evil brother Davis, and good ole Mason and his new bride, Cruella de Vil.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Poor, poor Pokey,&#x201d; Annajane mocked her right back. &#x201c;Richest girl in town, married to the second richest man in town.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Third richest,&#x201d; Pokey corrected. &#x201c;Or maybe fourth. Davis and Mason have way more money than Pete, especially since people quit buying furniture made in America.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Speaking of, where is Pete?&#x201d; Annajane asked, craning her neck to look for him. Instead of spotting Pokey&#x2019;s tall redheaded husband, Pete, her eyes rested on another tardy couple, Bonnie and Matthew Kelsey, hurrying up the right-side aisle of the church.<br>Bonnie Kelsey&#x2019;s eyes met Annajane&#x2019;s. She blushed, and looked away quickly, clutching Matthew&#x2019;s arm and steering him into a pew as far away from Annajane&#x2019;s as she could manage in the overcrowded church.<br>Pokey saw the maneuver for what it was. &#x201c;Bitch,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right,&#x201d; Annajane said smoothly. &#x201c;I mean, what do you expect? Matt and Mason play golf every week. From what I hear, Bonnie and Celia get along like a house afire. Best friends forever! Anyway, Bonnie&#x2019;s not the only one to sign up for Team Celia. Every woman in this room has been staring daggers at me since I walked into this church. I knew when I agreed to come today that it would be awkward.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Awkward?&#x201d; Pokey laughed bitterly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s freakish, is what it is. Who else but you would agree to show up at her ex-husband&#x2019;s wedding?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Whodunnit, Inc.<br></p><h2>Greece: A Traveler&#39;s Literary Companion (Traveler&#39;s Literary Companions)</h2><p>Discover Greece &#x2014; a country that has inspired centuries of travel &#x2014; through its best modern writers.

In this&nbsp; previously unpublished and only recently discovered diary, Iris Origo, author of the classic War in Val d&#x2019;Orcia, provides a vivid account of how Mussolini decided on a course of action that would devastate his country and ultimately destroy his regime.<br><br> Though the British-born Origo lived with her Italian husband on an estate in a remote part of Tuscany, she was supremely well-connected and regularly in touch with intellectual and diplomatic circles in Rome, where her godfather, William Phillips, was the American ambassador. Her diary describes the Fascist government&#x2019;s growing infatuation with Nazi Germany as Hitler&#x2019;s armies marched triumphantly across Europe and the campaign of propaganda and intimidation that was mounted in support of its new aims. The book ends with the birth of Origo&#x2019;s daughter and Origo&#x2019;s decision to go to Rome to work with prisoners of war at the Italian Red Cross.&nbsp;<br><br> Together with War in Val d&#x2019;Orcia, <i>A Chill in the Air</i> offers an indispensable record of Italy at war as well as a thrilling story of a formidable woman&#x2019;s transformation from observer to actor at a great historical turning point.</p><p><b>Iris Origo </b>(1902&#x2013;1988) was a British-born biographer and writer. She lived in Italy&nbsp;and devoted much of her life to the improvement of the Tuscan estate at La Foce,&nbsp;which she purchased with her husband in the 1920s. During the Second World&nbsp;War, she sheltered refugee children and assisted many escaped Allied prisoners of&nbsp;war and partisans in defiance of Italy&#x2019;s fascist regime and Nazi occupation forces.&nbsp;She is the author of <i>Images and Shadows; A Chill in the Air: An Italian War Diary,</i>&nbsp;<i>1939&#x2013;1940</i>; <i>Leopardi: A Study in Solitude</i>; and <i>The Merchant of Prato</i>, among others.<br><br><b>Lucy Hughes-Hallett </b>is a prizewinning historian and novelist.

Origo decided in March 1939 to keep the diary to help her remain &#x2018;steady&#x2019; as the government of her adopted homeland became increasingly hostile to her two countries of origin.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i></p><h2>A Million Windows</h2><p><i>A kaleidoscopic meditation on fiction-making by one of Australia's most acclaimed writers.</i><br><br><b>The house of fiction,</b> wrote Henry James, <b>has . . . not one window, but a million.<b> In this, his latest work, Gerald Murnane, one of Australia's most acclaimed contemporary authors, takes these words as his starting point, and asks: Who, exactly, are that house's residents, and what do they see from their respective rooms? His answer, <i>A Million Windows</i>, is a gorgeous (if unsettling) investigation into the glories and pitfalls of storytelling. Focusing on the importance of trust and the inevitability of betrayal in writing as in life, its nested stories explore the fraught relationships between author and reader, child and parent, boyfriend and girlfriend, husband and wife. Murnane's fiction is woven from images-the reflections of the setting sun on distant windowpanes, seemingly limitless grasslands, a procession of dark-haired women, a clearing in a forest, the colors indigo and silver-grey, and the mysterious death of a young woman-which build to an emotional crescendo that is all the more powerful for the intricacy of its patterning.</b></b></p><p>Gerald Murnane, one of Australia's most highly-regarded authors, has published ten volumes of fiction, including <i>Tamarisk Row</i>, <i>Inland</i>, <i>Barley Patch</i>, and <i>A History of Books</i>, and a collection of essays, <i>Invisible Yet Enduring Lilacs</i>.

Coetzee, <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>Murnane is a writer of such precision and irony that one hesitates to describe A Million Windows except to say that it will fascinate (and amuse and provoke) anyone who has driven past that house of 'two, or perhaps three, storeys', and wondered what exactly was going on inside. --Lorin Stein, <i>The Paris Review</i><br><br>...contemplative, deeply humane, dedicated above all to craft.--<i>World Literature Today</i><br><br>[A] beautiful and strange tale...[an] astonishing feat by a writer of profound conviction.--Michael Autrey, <i>Booklist</i><br><br>Murnane is a careful stylist and a slyly comic writer with large ideas.

The king's house had many other doors, but this was the door for petitions. Since the king spent all his time sitting at the door for favors (favors being offered to the king, you understand), whenever he heard someone knocking at the door for petitions, he would pretend not to hear . . ." Why the petitioner required a boat, where he was bound for, and who volunteered to crew for him, the reader will discover in this delightful fable, a philosophic love story worthy of Swift or Voltaire.<br></p><p><i>"A man went to knock at the king's door and said, Give me a boat."</i><p> Even without the "Once upon a time," it's clear from the opening sentence of Jos� Saramago's mischievous and wise <i>The Tale of the Unknown Island</i> that we have entered a somewhat fractured fairy tale. Of course, it could be argued that all of his works are, in some form or another, fairy tales, from the whimsical, revisionist <i>History of the Siege of Lisbon</i> to the darker dystopia of <i> Blindness</i>. Originally published as a short story in Portugal, <i>Unknown Island</i> contains all of the elements Saramago is famous for--dry wit, a seemingly simple plot that works on many levels, and an idiosyncratic use of punctuation, among other things. It begins as a satire concerned with the absurdity of bureaucracy as supplicants arrive at the king's door for petitions while the king himself waits by the door for favors: </p><blockquote> Since the king spent all his time sitting at the door for favors (favors being offered to the king, you understand), whenever he heard someone knocking at the door for petitions, he would pretend not to hear, and only when the continuous pounding of the bronze doorknocker became not just deafening, but positively scandalous, disturbing the peace of the neighborhood (people would start muttering, What kind of king is he if he won't even answer the door), only then would he order the first secretary to go and find out what the supplicant wanted, since there seemed no way of silencing him. </blockquote> On this particular occasion, the man at the door asks for a boat so that he can search for an unknown island. When the king assures him that all the islands have already been discovered, he refuses to believe it, explaining that one <i>must</i> exist "simply because there can't possibly not be an unknown island." A palace cleaning woman overhears the conversation, and when the king finally grants his supplicant a boat, she leaves the royal residence via the door of decisions and follows the would-be explorer. Saramago then moves from satire to allegory as his two dreamers prepare for their voyage of discovery--and nearly miss the forest for the trees. <i>The Tale of the Unknown Island</i> packs more charm and meaning into 50 tiny pages than most novels accomplish at five times the length. Readers already familiar with the Nobel Prize-winning Saramago will find everything they love about his longer works economically sized; for those who have not yet experienced the pleasures of his remarkable imagination, <i>Unknown Island</i> provides a charming introduction. <i>--Alix Wilber</i><p>JOS� SARAMAGO (1922&#x2013;2010) was the author of many novels, among them <i>Blindness, All the Names, Baltasar&nbsp;and Blimunda,</i> and <i>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.</i> In 1998 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.</p></p><h2>We&#39;ve Had a Hundred Years of Psychotherapy--And the World&#39;s Getting Worse</h2><p>This furious, trenchant, and audacious series of interrelated dialogues and letters takes a searing look at not only the legacy of psychotherapy, but also practically every aspect of contemporary living--from sexuality to politics, media, the environment, and life in the city.

Although traditional therapy assumes that healthy individuals make for a healthy world, Hillman ( Blue Fire , LJ 10/1/89) and Ventura ( Shadow Dancing in the U.S.A. , LJ 10/1/85) contend that therapy encourages self-preoccupation, leaving no attention or energy for the woes of the outside world. Similarly, the "inner child" movement has created a population of self-centered, juvenile adults who feel they have little power. Political apathy, a dying environment, and an inability to form real relationships are among the ills resulting from this solipsism. Hillman, who studied with Jung, and L.A. Weekly columnist Ventura offer no solutions, but their book bursts with vigorous ideas, tangents, and humor. Thought-provoking, fun, and not quite like anything else on the shelf.

Yogananda's translation and commentary brings a unique and deeply penetrating insight into this great scripture, which is widely regarded as one of the most comprehensive books available on the science and philosophy of Yoga. <i>God Talks With Arjuna</i> explains the Bhagavad Gita's profoundest spiritual, psychological, and metaphysical truths, long obscured by metaphor and allegory. Yogananda takes Lord Krishna's counsel to the warrior Arjuna and applies it to our everyday struggles with the human ego. Our greatest battle he explains, like Arjuna's, takes place within our own minds as we fight our doubts, fears, negative habits, self-defeating thoughts, and erroneous thinking. Appealing to scholar and general reader alike, there is no other Gita on the market as attractive, and comprehensive. Yogananda said, 'From the moment of conception to the surrender of the last breath, man has to fight in each incarnation innumerable battles: biological, hereditary, bacteriological, physiological, climatic, social, ethical, political, sociological, psychological, metaphysical - so many varieties of inner and outer conflicts. Competing for victory in every encounter are the forces of good and evil. The whole intent of the Gita is to align man's efforts on the side of dharma, or righteousness. The ultimate aim is Self-realization, the realization of man's true Self, the soul, as made in the image of God, one with the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss of Spirit.'</p><p>Born in India on January 5, 1893, Paramahansa Yogananda devoted his life to helping people of all races and creeds to realize and express more fully in their lives the true beauty, nobility, and divinity of the human spirit. After graduating from Calcutta University in 1915, Yogananda took formal vows as a monk of India's venerable monastic Swami Order. Two years later, he began his life's work with the founding of a how-to-live school since grown to twenty-one educational institutions throughout India where traditional academic subjects were offered together with yoga training and instruction in spiritual ideals. In 1920, he was invited to serve as India's delegate to an International Congress of Religious Liberals in Boston. His address to the Congress and subsequent lectures on the East Coast were enthusiastically received, and in 1924 he embarked on a cross-continental speaking tour. Over the next three decades, Paramahansa Yogananda contributed in far-reaching ways to a greater awareness and appreciation in the West of the spiritual wisdom of the East. In Los Angeles, he established an international headquarters for <b>Self-Realization Fellowship,</b> the nonsectarian religious society he had founded in 1920. Through his writings, extensive lecture tours, and the creation of Self-Realization Fellowship temples and meditation centers, he introduced hundreds of thousands of truth-seekers to the ancient science and philosophy of Yoga and its universally applicable methods of meditation. Today, the spiritual and humanitarian work begun by Paramahansa Yogananda continues under the direction of Sri Mrinalini Mata, one of his closest disciples and president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India since 2011. In addition to publishing his writings, lectures and informal talks (including a comprehensive series of Self-Realization Fellowship Lessons for home study), the society also oversees temples, retreats, and centers around the world.A great story of the inner struggle for spiritual growth, mankind's most important but most difficult and daring quest...This is a book that one can study and cherish for a lifetime. --Yoga International<br><br>A monumental work...a masterpiece of spiritual, literary, and philosophical work. --India Post<br><br>Yogananda's commentary penetrates to the heart of the Bhagavad Gita to reveals deep spiritual and psychological truths...Classic on how to live a spiritual life. --Publisher's Weekly</p><h2>The Hero</h2><p><p><strong>WHAT MAKES A HERO?

In Vietnam it was the bridge at Thanh Hoa, called Dragon's Jaw.<br><br>For seven long years hundreds of young US airmen flew sortie after sortie against North Vietnam's formidable and strategically important bridge, dodging a heavy concentration of anti-aircraft fire and enemy MiG planes. Many American airmen were shot down, killed, or captured and taken to the infamous "Hanoi Hilton" POW camp. But after each air attack, when the smoke cleared and the debris settled, the bridge stubbornly remained standing. For the North Vietnamese it became a symbol of their invincibility; for US war planners an obsession; for US airmen a testament to American mettle and valor.<br><br>Using after-action reports, official records, and interviews with surviving pilots, as well as untapped Vietnamese sources, <i>Dragon's Jaw</i> chronicles American efforts to destroy the bridge, strike by bloody strike, putting readers into the cockpits, under fire. The story of the Dragon's Jaw is a story rich in bravery, courage, audacity, and sometimes luck, sometimes tragedy. The "bridge" story of Vietnam is an epic tale of war against a determined foe.</p><p><b>Barrett Tillman</b> is a widely recognized authority on air warfare in World War II and the author of more than forty books, including <i>Clash of the Carriers</i> and <i>Whirlwind</i>.

There's the majestic lion, the braying mules, the dancing elephant, and the bouncy kangaroos. Even the fossils join in with a fast and rattly dance. Everyone is invited!</p><p>Nearly 150 years ago, the composer Camille Saint-Sa�ns was asked by his pupils to write a musical joke for them. He wrote the<i> Carnival of the Animals</i>, a piece people enjoyed so much that it has now become one of Saint-Sa�ns's most famous works.</p><p>This accessible commentary, in a picture-book format, helps children follow each section of Saint-Sa�ns's classic piece while they listen to the CD. Whimsical illustrations, a simple text, and evocative melodies create an ideal introduction for young children to the world of classical music.</p></p><p><p><b>Barrie Carson Turner</b> is a freelance musician who has written songs, musicals, and books. </p><p><b>Sue Williams</b> has won numerous awards for her work. Her illustrations have been featured in exhibition at the Louvre in Paris and at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-Glitzy and exciting packaging is what this book has going for it. Turner has written new commentary for Saint-Sa'ns's music, accompanied by a full-length, music-only CD, cleverly designed to fit into a plastic holder. In addition to offering one-page commentaries on the 14 sections of this famous musical work, Turner gives basic education on the orchestra used for the composition and helpful hints on how to listen for the distinctive animal sounds made by certain instruments. The text is serviceable, but the tone is condescending at times. "Do you think the elephant enjoys dancing? Do you think he knows that he can't dance very well?" Finer, more humorous commentary is available on the CD "Classical Zoo" (Telarc, 1997), with Itzhak Perlman as narrator and new poems by Bruce Adolphe, but then, it is only the recording. Practicality and management of the two resources in one are considerations for librarians, but Carnival of the Animals, while not perfect, is one way to get young children to listen to and absorb classical music. Williams's full-page and spot illustrations are colorful and fanciful, adding another dimension to the presentation.<br><i>Mollie Bynum, formerly at Chester Valley Elementary School, Anchorage, AK </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lectures on Quantum Mechanics</h2><p><p>The author of this concise, brilliant series of lectures on mathematical methods in quantum mechanics was one of the shining intellects in the field, winning a Nobel prize in 1933 for his pioneering work in the quantum mechanics of the atom. Beyond that, he developed the transformation theory of quantum mechanics (which made it possible to calculate the statistical distribution of certain variables), was one of the major authors of the quantum theory of radiation, codiscovered the Fermi-Dirac statistics, and predicted the existence of the positron.<br>The four lectures in this book were delivered at Yeshiva University, New York, in 1964. The first, "The Hamiltonian Method," is an introduction to visualizing quantum theory through the use of classical mechanics. The remaining lectures build on that idea. "The Problem of Quantization" shows how one can start with a classical field theory and end up with a quantum field theory. In "Quantization on Curved Surfaces," Dirac examines the possibility of building a relativistic quantum theory on curved surfaces. He deduces that it is not possible, but it should be possible on flat surfaces. In the final lecture, "Quantization on Flat Surfaces," he concludes that "we can set up the basic equations for a quantum theory of the Born-Infeld electrodynamics agreeing with special relativity, but [not] with general relativity." Physics and chemistry students will find this book an invaluable addition to their libraries, as will anyone intrigued by the far-reaching and influential ideas of quantum mechanics. </p><p></p></p><p><p><b>The Physics of Pretty Mathematics</b> <br>One of the founders of quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics, Paul A. M. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schr�dinger, "for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory." </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"A good deal of my research in physics has consisted in not setting out to solve some particular problem, but simply examining mathematical equations of a kind that physicists use and trying to fit them together in an interesting way, regardless of any application that the work may have. It is simply a search for pretty mathematics. It may turn out later to have an application. Then one has good luck." </p><p> </p><p>"The mathematician plays a game in which he himself invents the rules while the physicist plays a game in which the rules are provided by nature, but as time goes on it becomes increasingly evident that the rules which the mathematician finds interesting are the same as those which nature has chosen." &#x2014; Paul A.

The Dover edition didn't appear until 2001. The clarity of Dirac's presentation is truly compelling (no mystery at all!). Very little background is required on the part of the reader. Dirac begins with the Hamiltonian method, and then passes to quantization in terms of physics. The mathematics of quantization on curved (and flat) surfaces is clearly presented in the second part of the book." &#x2014; Palle E.T.

The writer recounts the major reforms of Solon, the rule of the tyrant Pisistratus and his sons, the emergence of the democracy in which power was shared by all free male citizens, and the leadership of Pericles and the demagogues who followed him. He goes on to examine the city's administration in his own time - the council, the officials and the judicial system. For its information on Athens' development and how the democracy worked, <i>The Athenian Constitution</i> is an invaluable source of knowledge about the Athenian city-state.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

It illustrates how authoritarianism is embedded in the way people think, hiding in culture, values, daily life, and in the very morality people try to live by. The book unmasks authoritarianism in such areas as relationships, cults, 12-step groups, religion, and contemporary morality. Chapters on addiction and love show the insidious nature of authoritarian values and ideologies in the most intimate corners of life, offering new frameworks for understanding why people get addicted and why intimacy is laden with conflict. By exposing the inner authoritarian that people use to control themselves and others, the authors show why people give up their power, and how others get and maintain it.</p><p>Joel Kramer and Diana Alstad are co-authors of <i>The Guru Papers: Masks of Authoritarian Power</i>.

Narrated by an unheroic, apparently rudderless hero named Random, Smollett&#39;s wildly energetic and entertaining novel is held together not least by the narrator&#39;s outrage and dismay. Although Roderick Random was first published anonymously, the secret of Smollett&#39;s authorship was soon discovered, with the result that many readers thought they recognized similarities between the life of the hero and that of his creator. Certainly Roderick Random&#39;s early years - disinherited and without wealth and influence - and his university career, apprenticeship and service as a naval surgeon, vividly reflect the experiences of the author. How Random learns to survive the fickle hand of fortune, recovers his long-lost father, marries his beloved Narcissa, and dispatches his enemies is the stuff, not of autobiography but of a novel which profoundly satirizes the moral chaos of its times. Dickens and Thackeray, among other great Victorians, applauded Smollett for his wit and invention, and in Roderick Random we enjoy the novel of a pioneer opening up the frontiers of fiction.<b>Anthony Trollope </b>(1815-1882) was born in London to a bankrupt barrister father and a mother who, as a well-known writer, supported the family. Trollope enjoyed considerable acclaim both as a novelist and as a senior civil servant in the Post Office. He published more than forty novels and many short stories that are regarded by some as among the greatest of nineteenth-century fiction.</p><h2>1 Timothy MacArthur New Testament Commentary (Volume 24) (MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p><p>Paul wrote this letter to Timothy to encourage and instruct him in the ministry.&nbsp;As a young pastor, Timothy faced many temptations and challenges.&nbsp;But Paul encouraged him to be courageous and remain faithful.&nbsp;The personal warmth and pastoral instruction of this letter make studying it essential for those who would lead in the church.</p><p>Join John MacArthur as he explains each verse in a way that is both doctrinally precise and intensely practical.&nbsp;Taking into account the cultural, theological, and Old Testament contexts of each passage, MacArthur tackles interpretive challenges and fairly evaluates differing views, giving the reader confidence in his conclusions. </p><p>The MacArthur New Testament Commentary series comes from the experience, wisdom, and insight of one of the most trusted ministry leaders and Bible scholars of our day.

Yakov&#x2019;s goatee was flecked with gray. Over the years his cheeks had ballooned and taken on a happy glow. His clothing choices for work had migrated from a cheap sagging suit, pressed white shirt, and thrift-store tie circa 1984 to a polo shirt and jeans with tasseled loafers sans socks. He was waiting, perhaps, for the day that global warming would bring the ocean to the Great Plains. This miracle, if it took place, would be welcome to Yakov but not necessary. Life in America had been good.</p><p>I was in Yakov&#x2019;s office, its well-worn vinyl floor covered with the grime of twenty years of use slightly mitigated by perfunctory cleaning. It was early afternoon eleven years ago, in the winter of 2001. The wind outside barely blew. The sky was crystal blue. Looking through the double-paned glass, those inexperienced with the Midwest might be fooled into thinking it was warm outside, at least warm for January. Both Yakov and I knew better. &#x201c;My mother is hanging in there,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You know her. She&#x2019;s not going down until she&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A remarkable woman.&#x201d; Yakov was from Russia. When a Russian mathematician mentioned my mother, this phrase &#x201c;remark- able woman&#x201d; would often follow. It was a phrase my father would use as well, but often in a sarcastic way.</p><p>Yakov had come to the United States in 1986 and taught at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. He was lucky to have eventually found this job. Many of my parents&#x2019; acquaintances who had emigrated from Russia in the 1970s and 1980s were doing things far afield from mathematics in order to put food on the table. I, unlike Yakov, had come to the United States as a young child. My memories of the former Soviet Union were fuzzy at best. Given what I had heard about Russia from my parents and their friends, I knew that this fuzziness was not a bad thing.</p><p>I was giving a talk at Nebraska&#x2019;s atmospheric sciences department, but when people in the math department heard I was coming, they filled up half of my appointment schedule. I was used to this. It was never about me. It was about my mother. She was the stuff of legend.</p><p>She was five foot eight, a tall glass of water by European (and maybe even American) standards, who tended to tower over men, including my father, in her heels. She favored gray or burgundy suits tailored by a local dressmaker and owned well over two hundred pairs of shoes, an obsession that she said derived from her poverty during World War II. She would probably have been even taller had she not starved during the war. My mother never needed a microphone. When she spoke it was with the cadence of an oracle. She had been banned from teaching calculus at her university simply because she scared the hell out of freshmen.</p><p>When my mother was ten years old, she was living in an Arctic Circle work camp where her father, a Jewish Pole/Russian (every decade or so, control of his hometown would change from one country to the other), was sentenced to hard labor for being a capitalist Enemy of the People. At school on the frozen tundra along the Barents Sea, my mother showed a remarkable facility for mathematics. In Russia, math is not just a means to an end. It&#x2019;s a glorious art. Suddenly, my mother&#x2019;s family got a little bit of meat and flour in addition to their wrinkled potatoes and onions. Another Enemy of the People, a professor of mathematics, was told to tutor my mother three times a week. Like many, he never made it back home.</p><p>My mother, formerly a Pole, then a full-fledged citizen of the glorious USSR due to the Soviet annexation of her hometown after the war, was sent to Moscow for further study in 1945. These were heady times in Russian mathematics, and the most admired mathematician of all was her advisor, the great Kolmogorov. My mother began to publish papers when she was sixteen. She defected to the West in 1951, after giving a talk in East Berlin. My mother became a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsin at the age of twenty-two. At twenty-eight, she was offered a tenured professorship at Princeton, which somehow promised to ignore its rules on nepotism and hire my father as well. She turned them down. Like Kolmogorov and many of his acolytes, she believed that cold weather was required for the creative mind. New Jersey simply was too warm. Plus, according to her, Princeton was a haven for anti-Semites, and she&#x2019;d already had her fill of that in Russia and Poland. She stayed in Wisconsin.</p><p>In 1999, after sixty-nine years without a single major health issue, my mother was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer. Her doctor told her to expect to live three to six months. &#x201c;Nonsense,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I have a good year of things to do.&#x201d;</p><p>A year and a half later, she was down to eighty-five pounds. As I walked out of Yakov&#x2019;s office, I got the call on my cell phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to die today,&#x201d; she said.</p></p><h2>A Concise Guide to Canon Law; A Practical Handbook for Pastoral Ministers</h2><p><p>Pastoral ministers are faced with new questions and challenges every day, and answers aren't always easy to find.

He examines the meditative methods and traditions found within contemplative prayer.</p><p><p>Erin Bennett is the audiobook reader for this edition. She is an actress, singer, and voice-over artist whose passion for storytelling informs her love of narrating audiobooks. Her genres vary widely from contemporary fiction to mysteries to science fiction and romance.</p><br>"This is a beautifully written book. The language is profound, poetic, and free of worn cliches. It has obviously grown out of a life of study, erudition, and personal prayer." --<em>Worship</em><p></p><br>"<em>Into the Silent Land</em> by Martin Laird is a wonderful introduction to the subject of contemplation. It has a vitality and relevance that are gripping. Contemplative books are often dry, but I found this a page-turner." --<em>Church Times</em><p></p><br>"In a world hungering for practical spiritual direction on how to manage distractions, moods, bodily posture, breathing, suffering, illness, addiction, and dying, Laird's book stands out as a treasure to share with anyone who is seeking greater wisdom and peace. He provides us with an eminently accessible doorway into the land of God's loving silence." --<em>Horizons</em><p></p><br>"Larid's book defines how to sink back in God's ground physically with breathing, mentally with "prayer words," and spiritually with interior surrender. Through anecdote, Scripture, and classic wisdom, Laird illuminates a Christian path into the silent land. An able guide, he makes the trip more than worth the journey." --<em>Christianity Today</em><p></p><br>"This book is different. There are plenty of books on contemplation that feel rather tired--either wordy and labored or unhelpfully smooth and idealistic. But this is sharp, deep, with no clich�s, no psychobabble and no short cuts. Its honesty is bracing, its vision utterly clear; it is a rare treasure."--Rowan Williams, The Archbishop of Canterbury<p></p><br>"Often they say 'you learn how to swim by swimming' but a good coach or swimming manual is essential. Equally, we could say 'you learn how to be contemplative by contemplating' and a good guide or mentor is necessary. <em>Into the Silent Land</em> is just that. I tried it and it works. Try it."--Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize<p></p><br>"This is a beautifully written book. The language is profound, poetic, and free of worn clich�s. It has obviously grown out of a life of study, erudition and personal prayer."--<em>Worship</em><p></p><br>"<em>Into the Silent Land</em> is a beautiful and deeply consoling book, a reminder that prayer is both real and fundamentally simple. Not since Thomas Merton's <em>Contemplative Prayer</em> have I encountered a guide to contemplation this wise and compelling."--Douglas Burton-Christie, author of <em>The Word in the</em> <em>Desert: Scripture and the Quest for Holiness in Early Christian Monasticism</em><p></p><br>"With wisdom born of a life of prayer and study, Martin Laird invites us out of distraction and into the silent land where God is waiting. Taking the realities of affliction, fear and failure seriously, Laird offers an approach to contemplative life that is within reach of us all." --Stephanie Paulsell, author of <em>Honoring the Body: Meditations on a Christian Practice</em><p></p><br>"Martin Laird's book is a compelling introduction to contemplative prayer. He draws on insights from the Eastern Orthodox tradition of the Jesus Prayer, from the Western Carmelite tradition, from poets and novelists and from his own experience as retreat director and confessor. In the silent land, our wounds become radiant sources of compassion."--Andrew Louth, author of <em>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition: From Plato to Denys</em><p></p><br>"<em>Into the Silent Land</em> reflects a happy combination of wide learning, authentic spiritual experience, and clear jargon-free prose. This work should be of inestimable value for anyone interested in the Christian contemplative tradition of prayer."--Lawrence S.

THE White House.<br><br>World War II is in full force across the seas. It's 1943, President Roosevelt is in office, and Diana's father, Harry Hopkins, is his chief advisor. And Diana wants to be part of the war effort. After some well-intentioned missteps (her quarantine sign on her father's office door was not well-received), the President requests her help with his newest plan for the country's survival: Victory Gardens!<br>From award-winning author Elisa Carbone comes the true story of how Diana Hopkins started her own Victory Garden on the White House lawn under the tutelage of Eleanor Roosevelt. With dedication and patience, she showed the nation that the war effort started first on the homefront.</p><p>Elisa Carbone lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Hendricks, West Virginia.

Visit her at jenhill.com.K-Gr 3&#x2014;Diana (Hopkins) Halsted, the daughter of one of Franklin Roosevelt's close advisors, lived at the White House during World War II. Without other children around, she spends most of her time with Fala, the Roosevelts' dog. After her playful activities get her in trouble with the White House staff, it is decided that a good way to direct Diana's energy would be for her to take care of a Victory Garden on the lawn. The 10-year-old becomes part of a publicity plan to encourage people all over the country to help the war effort by growing their own food. This book connects with the current day as Michelle Obama and many schools are involved in gardening, and demonstrates how that movement has roots in the 1940s. An author's note describes conversations with the real Diana, who is still living. The style of the illustrations reflects the time period. Created with pencil, gouache, and digital methods, sepia-toned backgrounds are drawn but not filled in or completely colored. Painted people and Fala are fully colored and appear more solid. They are arranged on the pages almost like characters on a stage or paper dolls being moved through different scenes. The effect is visually interesting but not highly engaging for children. The pictures reflect great attention to detail, with people of varying races featured in street scenes in Washington, DC. Front endpapers show the garden plants sprouting, while those at the back include vegetables ready for harvest.

The authors hold that the organizing principles of a given piece of music may be gleaned from studying: the internal attributes that give a section its specific identity; the functional relations between sections; the ordering of those sections.<p> Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Spring-Hutcheson, <i>Musical Form and Analysis: Time, Pattern, Proportion</i> (ISBN 9781478607229).</p></p><p>&#34;I have long been searching for a book of this type.

The boy races after them, grabs onto the ladder of their spaceship, and boards it just as it blasts off.

He published almost 1500 scholarly papers before his death in 1996, and he probably thought more about math problems than anyone in history. Like a traveling salesman offering his thoughts as wares, Erdos would show up on the doorstep of one mathematician or another and announce, "My brain is open." After working through a problem, he'd move on to the next place, the next solution.<br><br> Hoffman's book, like Sylvia Nasar's biography of John Nash, <em>A Beautiful Mind</em>, reveals a genius's life that transcended the merely quirky. But Erdos's brand of madness was joyful, unlike Nash's despairing schizophrenia. Erdos never tried to dilute his obsessive passion for numbers with ordinary emotional interactions, thus avoiding hurting the people around him, as Nash did. Oliver Sacks writes of Erdos: "A mathematical genius of the first order, Paul Erdos was totally obsessed with his subject--he thought and wrote mathematics for nineteen hours a day until the day he died. He traveled constantly, living out of a plastic bag, and had no interest in food, sex, companionship, art--all that is usually indispensable to a human life."<br><br> <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> is easy to love, despite his strangeness. It's hard not to have affection for someone who referred to children as "epsilons," from the Greek letter used to represent small quantities in mathematics; a man whose epitaph for himself read, "Finally I am becoming stupider no more"; and whose only really necessary tool to do his work was a quiet and open mind.<br><br> Hoffman, who followed and spoke with Erdos over the last 10 years of his life, introduces us to an undeniably odd, yet pure and joyful, man who loved numbers more than he loved God--whom he referred to as SF, for Supreme Fascist. He was often misunderstood, and he certainly annoyed people sometimes, but Paul Erdos is no doubt missed. --Therese Littleton</p><p><strong>Paul Hoffman</strong> was president of Encyclopedia Britannica and editor-in-chief of <em>Discover</em>, and is the author of <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> and <em>The Wings of Madness</em>. He is the winner of the first National Magazine Award for Feature Writing, and his work has appeared in the <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Time</em>, and <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. He lives in Woodstock, NY.An affectionate if impressionistic portrayal of one of the century's greatest and strangest mathematicians. Though little known among nonmathematicians, Erdos, who died in 1996 at age 83, was a legend among his colleagues. According to Hoffman (Archimedes' Revenge, 1988), the Hungarian was so devoted to mathematics that he went without wife, children, steady job, or even a home, preferring to exist as the wandering guest of fellow mathematicians. He lived for math, announcing his visits with a hearty, ``My brain is open,'' posing and solving problems while subsisting on amphetamines and coffee (`` `A mathematician,' Erdos was fond of saying, `is a machine for turning coffee into theorems' ''), and forgoing pleasantries like ``Good morning'' to jump right in with, ``Let n be an integer.'' He published more than 1,500 papers with at least 484 coauthors, who pride themselves on their ``Erds number of 1'' (a figure indicating one's degree of separation from the master). Hoffman, who traveled with and interviewed many of his collaborators, weaves oral histories and clear mathematical explication into a digressive (sometimes too digressive), entertaining whole. Hoffman creates a full-bodied and eccentric character out of hundreds of quotations and anecdotes. Missing are the linear landmarks of conventional biography: Erdos doesn't get born until page 48, a precise account of his death is absent, and his most important mathematical discoveries are nowhere summarized. Though a biography, this book works like the best fiction, finding in a concrete universal to show what mathematics is and who the people are who uncover its truths.

Haley's gripping naval saga.</b><br><br>Following the naval victories of the War of 1812 and the Second Barbary War, the United States is finally expanding its navy to take a place of prominence in world affairs. Bliven Putnam, now Captain of the sloop of war <i>Rappahannock</i>, has come into his own as a leader and is ordered to the Pacific. But with this new tour of duty to last more than two years, his patient wife, Clarity, unwilling to accept such a brief time together, at last puts her foot down. If she can't keep Putnam with her, then she'll just have to go with him.<br><br>As Putnam sets sail for his new home port in Honolulu, Clarity joins a new missionary effort from Boston to Hawaii. On their respective paths, the Putnams encounter a new breed of pirate and meet an unexpected force of nature: Kahumanu, the formidable queen of the Hawaiian Islands. Inspried by the real-life Olowalu Massacre and the famed Congregationalist missoin of 1819, this third outing will be unlike any adventure the Putnams have faced before.</p><p><b>James L. Haley</b> is the award-winning author of <i>The Shores of Tripoli</i> and <i>A Darker Sea</i>, as well as numerous books on Native American, Texas, and Western history, and historical and contemporary fiction.

"Enter!" His voice was hoarse, and he coughed out a small clot of phlegm into the handkerchief that stayed by his pillow. He had slept soundly, the sea swell directly astern of them, powerful, gentle, rhythmic, and as he had fallen asleep it seemed to propel him forward into his dreams.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good morning, Captain."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Good morning, Mr. Ross." His steward was a short man, of gracile build, with very wavy ash-blond hair, slightly dish-faced but not unpleasantly so, and with hazel eyes beneath woolly brows so heavy that they seemed always knit in worry. He bore a wooden tray with water, coffee, and a covered plate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bliven rubbed his eyes, rose stiffly from his berth, and entered his sea cabin. "I am eating alone this morning?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sir"-Ross scooted aside a chart of the southern coast of Cuba that lay on the great mahogany table and set the wooden tray in its place-"the lookout sighted a sail just a moment ago. The officers are already on deck."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Where away?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They make her three miles, sir, northwest."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bliven paused to enjoy the morning sun streaming in the stern windows. "Toward the reef."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It would seem so, sir."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"M-hm." If it was a pirate or a slaver, he was doing just what he needed to: trying to draw them into shallow water. Well, as dearly as Bliven would have loved to take a slaver out of the trade, he would not be drawn in. Even after more than a decade it made his gorge rise to think of how Bainbridge lost the gallant Philadelphia at Tripoli, racing into shoal waters where he had no business going.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ross set his breakfast down next to the still-open logbook in which Bliven had been writing the night before. Even before his first sip of coffee he took up the pen, flipped open the inkwell, and dipped the nib. He paused to wake up a bit more, for if there was one thing that had come to irritate him, it was an inconsistent hand in the captain's record of the ship's operation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>October 20, 1817. At dawn, sail sighted three miles northwest, toward the reef. Suspicion of illicit activity, will give chase and investigate, but not enter Spanish territorial waters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bliven cleared the pen with a tidy rubric and set it in its stand. "How is the wind?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Easterly, sir. We have our will of him."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maybe." Yes, they held the weather gage, if they chose to use it. Bliven rose and walked stiffly across his great cabin and closed himself into the privy. In the old design of ships he would have had to exit onto a narrow quarter gallery to access it, and as in the old design the close stool itself emptied over the open water, but for this new generation of ships the architects had reworked the whole design of a captain's accommodation. Now it was divided by partitions into a six-compartment suite, with separate areas for working, sleeping, hosting guests, all surrounding the great sea cabin with its fine mahogany furniture-heavy, polished, elegant, but no longer fashionable and no doubt appropriated from some earlier vessel now stricken from the list-for dining and entertaining. Along the after bulkhead of his study, which lay to starboard and was matched by a guest berth to port, reposed the ten-foot assemblies of twenty-four-pounders on their carriages, their gunports closed against the weather. They served as reminders that in a battle even the captain's suite fought, and one feature of the new architecture was that its partitions were collapsible. In beating to quarters, the partitions were lowered and the captain's furnishings were stowed below in the wardroom, shared by the other officers at the stern of the berth deck. Thus the working frenzy of the gun deck in battle extended the whole length of the ship, from stern windows forward to the sick bay in the bow. Then, after the fight, even if the ship was ravaged by raking fire through the large, sunny windows, the partitions could be raised again and the furniture brought back up, and the captain and his guests could still dine in elegance and privacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the privy, on a shelf bolted to the bulkhead, Bliven saw a new stack of small cut squares of lamb's wool, and wondered when Ross could have replenished them, for he did not remember them from the night before. He crossed again to his berth, where hot water steamed in its basin next to his razor and towel, and Ross had laid out his uniform, complete except for the body within it, then regarded again the breakfast laid out on the vast slab of a mahogany table with its silver accouterments. For a Connecticut farmer raised to do for himself, Bliven decided that the perquisites of command were not to be disdained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He did not sit again but ate-eggs, a fresh pork chop, and toasted bread with jam-as he dressed. Their stores were fresh and plenty, for they had made a port call at Santiago de Cuba to spend money and try to assure them of America's friendship in the face of General Jackson's incursions into Spanish Florida chasing Seminole Indians, and their unending boundary disputes. That required diplomacy: Spain's crumbling empire could no longer afford to contest for Florida, which the United States wanted, but it was also desirable to preserve Spanish pride and good relations. Bliven had always been curious to see Santiago's looming Castillo de San Pedro de la Roca, to see for himself what kind of harbor fortification could take more than sixty years to build, and he got an eyeful, for they had anchored in its very shadow. The oldest parts dated back two centuries, separated from the mainland by a yawning moat, and supplied by sea, its storehouse cut into the living rock of the cliffs. The fortress's rising, receding terraces were lined with batteries of heavy guns, not unlike the decks of a ship of the line. Bliven had saluted the fort as he came gliding in under topgallants; the answering guns shook the Rappahannock's timbers, and he realized there was a reason that Spain, whatever her fallen state now, once ruled the western hemisphere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Santiago they rounded Cabo Cruz, on the lookout partly for slave runners-a task to which they were bound, since the African slave trade was outlawed in 1808-but still more alert for pirates, who now infested the Caribbean in more, and more devious, ways than in years past. The ongoing liberation of South America from Spain created new nations, who needed some semblance of navies and who even, as the United States had once done, turned to the contracting of privateers to establish a presence at sea. Many of those privateers, they now knew, were merely former pirates plying their old trade under the protection of new national flags. Since the close of the Second Barbary War, more than a thousand merchantmen had disappeared in the Caribbean, and, while maintaining some presence in the Mediterranean, much of the U.S. naval strength was now turned to the Caribbean to pacify that historically lawless sea. The very capable Hazard Perry had been dispatched to newly independent Venezuela-again, officially to demonstrate American friendship, but when out of sight of land to put pirates out of commission when they could not prove their bona fides. Bliven's task, in the northern Caribbean, was to intercept buccaneers whom Perry flushed from the coast of South America.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was impossible not to think of President Washington's often-published farewell warning, that the United States should avoid entangling herself in foreign alliances, and smile. In the mere three years-three years just past the day-since the British had burned Washington in the attempt to reestablish her North American empire, the United States had become irretrievably enmeshed in world affairs. And this was no bad thing, from the standpoint of trade, by which America was profiting most handsome, nor from the standpoint of those many who viewed their homespun democracy as a light to the world, who believed in it so ardently as to see it as the desired hope of mankind. There was even the latest talk in the Navy of showing the Stars and Stripes again in the Pacific, that giant quadrant of the globe with exotic and potentially vast trade in which the United States had only dabbled in the most exploratory way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To all this was required a Navy commensurate with the responsibility, and it was a thrill, a daily thrill every morning when Ross rapped on his cabin door, to be a part of. Ross was pouring coffee, elevating the silver pot as he did so as to aerate the brew as it swirled into the cup. "Sugar yet, Captain?" He grinned with a faint slyness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you, no, Mr. Ross, I have not acquired a taste for sweet coffee in the past twelve hours." He knew Ross was joking, a venturesome familiarity for a steward with his captain, but Bliven had never attained the full stiffness of his rank, and he allowed something like friendship between himself and those whose duties touched him most closely. At Santiago de Cuba they had bought thirty barrels of sugar to leave some silver in their wake, with little use for it but to serve the crew the sweetest plum duff in the history of the Navy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After Santiago they had put in at Cienfuegos, four hundred miles by sail west of there, a settlement less than a year old, to check on how their Louisiana colonists were faring. Here, too, there was a double purpose to the call, most assuredly to show their home country's amicable interest in developing this fertile and potentially rich portion of the island, but also to satisfy themselves that, being Louisianans about to engage in large-scale agriculture, they were not crossing that filmy boundary between utilizing slaves on their plantations and profiting from any transshipment of slaves to the U.S. mainland.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bliven sawed easily through the tender chop of pork, to which he added a yellow fluff of egg, and slurped a sip of the hot brew. Every time he drank coffee he thought of Sam Bandy, who still made the Putnam family a present every Christmas of a sack of the finest Martinique beans. And they reciprocated with a jug of the first and finest draw of maple syrup, and always a barrel of their Putnam Farm cider. He and Sam did not correspond as frequently as they had during Sam's recuperation after the War of 1812. And directly after hard service in that conflict Bliven had been sent under Decatur on the Guerriere back to the Mediterranean for the Second Barbary War. That was a cruise he actually enjoyed, for he had come to like Decatur, and he especially took pleasure in reducing and capturing the cursed Meshuda, which had slipped from their grasp in the first Mediterranean conflict. That was more bracing duty than trying to explain to people since then that this Guerriere was a new American frigate, not a resurrection of the British ship destroyed by the Constitution in 1812. The U.S. Navy had, on occasion, adopted the English penchant for naming new ships after defeated enemy vessels. The custom tasted of British arrogance and, he believed, had no place in the fleet of a democracy, but his consultation was not sought in the matter.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Home again, he'd barely had time to turn around before being sent to the Caribbean to help quell piracy and the slave trade. Clarity and his parents had all let Bliven know their despair at losing him back to sea so soon after coming safe home, to the point that they could barely share in his triumph at being once more elevated to his own command, and in the rank of captain, at last.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Shoes, sir," said Ross as he plopped them onto the Brussels rug that Bliven had spread in his compartment. Bliven stared at them with disgust and then slipped them on. Boots were harder to get on and off, and were lost if one were wounded and they had to be cut away, but that was a small price to pay to avoid fighting a battle feeling like one was kitted out for a dancing lesson. Ross helped him into his blue cutaway coat, and pulled lightly at the gold lace around the cuffs and collar. "Three-eighths of an inch, Captain, not a tittle less."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, for heaven's sake." The Navy had found the most astonishing regulations to insist upon other than defense. Ross handed him his sword, which he buckled on, and bicorne. With the hat tucked in the crook of his arm, he regarded himself in the full standing mirror, satisfied. He took several more rapid bites of breakfast, drained the coffee, and said mostly to himself, "All right."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He started to leave but heard Ross's voice behind him, "Your glass, Captain." He turned and Ross had it almost into his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, yes, thank you." Outside his cabin he strode quickly forward down the gun deck, surveying its double file of twenty-fours and finding all in order as he reached the ladder. Below on the berth deck he could hear the crewmen greedily downing their breakfast as he ascended the ladder to the weather deck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>His new sloop of war, Rappahannock, twenty-six, fresh from the yard, represented something of a change in policy for the government. With the end of every conflict, after the Navy had more than proved its worth, the Congress would pare it down to save money, lay up ships in ordinary, and furlough officers to half pay. The country would retreat into its shell like a hermit crab, hoping the world that it refused to see by covering its eyes would therefore not exist. Bliven admitted the expense of maintaining ships at sea, but the United States would never assume a place of respect in the family of nations until they deployed the means to defend that vast merchant fleet on which the American economy depended more than ever.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The end of the Second Barbary War, however, presented such a new set of circumstances that for once the nation took a different tack. James Monroe, secretary of state under Madison in the last war, was now president. He was a diplomat, he had been abroad, he understood the still-colonial attitude of the Old World toward the New, and he wanted to make it clear that this was no longer acceptable. On land the War of 1812-the Second War for Independence-had gained them no new territory. As Bliven's father had foreseen, the invasions of the Canadas had been a collective disaster, but conquest had never been the primary goal. At sea American victories, and America's willingness to pay the price for those victories as with the loss of the President and the Chesapeake, won America freedom from impressment, which indeed had been their primary reason for going to war.</p></p><h2>The Furies (Kent Family Chronicles)</h2><p>The eight-volume epic of the Kent family continues as a new generation struggles to survive within a nation rife with conflict.

It says that a child "should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love, and understanding," and "not be separated from his or her parents against their will ..." Part of Article 9 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child (1959), these words stand now as a fairy-tale ideal, the promise of a shield between children and the costs of globalization.At the moment this shield is not protecting the Bautista family from those human costs. In the basement bedroom of her employer's home in Washington, D.C., Rowena Bautista keeps four pictures on her dresser: two of her own children, back in Camiling, a Philippine farming village, and two of children she has cared for as a nanny in the United States. The pictures of her own children, Clinton and Princela, are from five years ago. As she recently told <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Robert Frank, the recent photos "remind me how much I've missed."1 She has missed the last two Christmases,and on her last visit home, her son Clinton, now eight, refused to touch his mother. "Why," he asked, "did you come back?"The daughter of a teacher and an engineer, Rowena Bautista worked three years toward an engineering degree before she quit and went abroad for work and adventure. A few years later, during her travels, she fell in love with a Ghanaian construction worker, had two children with him, and returned to the Philippines with them. Unable to find a job in the Philippines, the father of her children went to Korea in search of work and, over time, he faded from his children's lives.Rowena again traveled north, joining the growing ranks of Third World mothers who work abroad for long periods of time because they cannot make ends meet at home. She left her children with her mother, hired a nanny to help out at home, and flew to Washington, D.C., where she took a job as a nanny for the same pay that a small-town doctor would make in the Philippines. Of the 792,000 legal household workers in the United States, 40 percent were born abroad, like Rowena. Of Filipino migrants, 70 percent, like Rowena, are women.Rowena calls Noa, the American child she tends, "my baby." One of Noa's first words was "Ena," short for Rowena. And Noa has started babbling in Tagalog, the language Rowena spoke in the Philippines. Rowena lifts Noa from her crib mornings at 7:00 A.M., takes her to the library, pushes her on the swing at the playground, and curls up with her for naps. As Rowena explained to Frank, "I give Noa what I can't give to my children." In turn, the American child gives Rowena what she doesn't get at home. As Rowena puts it, "She makes me feel like a mother."Rowena's own children live in a four-bedroom house with her parents and twelve other family members--eight of them children, some of whom also have mothers who work abroad. The central figure in the children's lives--the person they call "Mama"--is Grandma, Rowena's mother. But Grandma works surprisingly long hours as a teacher--from 7:00 A.M. to 9:00 P.M. As Rowena tells her story to Frank, she says little about her father, the children's grandfather (men are discouraged from participating actively in child rearing in the Philippines). And Rowena's father is not much involved with his grandchildren. So, she has hired Anna de la Cruz, who arrives daily at 8:00 A.M. to cook, clean, and care for the children. Meanwhile,Anna de la Cruz leaves her teenage son in the care of her eighty-year-old mother-in-law.Rowena's life reflects an important and growing global trend: the importation of care and love from poor countries to rich ones. For some time now, promising and highly trained professionals have been moving from ill-equipped hospitals, impoverished schools, antiquated banks, and other beleaguered workplaces of the Third World to better opportunities and higher pay in the First World. As rich nations become richer and poor nations become poorer, this one-way flow of talent and training continuously widens the gap between the two. But in addition to this brain drain, there is now a parallel but more hidden and wrenching trend, as women who normally care for the young, the old, and the sick in their own poor countries move to care for the young, the old, and the sick in rich countries, whether as maids and nannies or as day-care and nursing-home aides. It's a care drain.The movement of care workers from south to north is not altogether new. What is unprecedented, however, is the scope and speed of women's migration to these jobs. Many factors contribute to the growing feminization of migration. One is the growing split between the global rich and poor. In 1949 Harry S. Truman declared in his inaugural speech that the Southern Hemisphere--encompassing the postcolonial nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America--was underdeveloped, and that it was the role of the north to help the south "catch up." But in the years since then, the gap between north and south has only widened. In 1960, for example, the nations of the north were twenty times richer than those of the south. By 1980, that gap had more than doubled, and the north was forty-six times richer than the south. In fact, according to a United Nations Development Program study, sixty countries are <i>worse off</i> in 1999 than they were in 1980.2 Multinational corporations are the "muscle and brains" behind the new global system with its growing inequality, as William Greider points out, and the 500 largest such corporations (168 in Europe, 157 in the United States, and 119 in Japan) have in the last twenty years increased their sales sevenfold.3As a result of this polarization, the middle class of the Third World now earns less than the poor of the First World. Before the domestic workers Rhacel Parre�as interviewed in the 1990s migrated from thePhilippines to the United States and Italy, they had averaged $176 a month, often as teachers, nurses, and administrative and clerical workers. But by doing less skilled--though no less difficult--work as nannies, maids, and care-service workers, they can earn $200 a month in Singapore, $410 a month in Hong Kong, $700 a month in Italy, or $1,400 a month in Los Angeles. To take one example, as a fifth-grade dropout in Colombo, Sri Lanka, a woman could earn $30 a month plus room and board as a housemaid, or she could earn $30 a month as a salesgirl in a shop, without food or lodging. But as a nanny in Athens she could earn $500 a month, plus room and board.The remittances these women send home provide food and shelter for their families and often a nest egg with which to start a small business. Of the $750 Rowena Bautista earns each month in the United States, she mails $400 home for her children's food, clothes, and schooling, and $50 to Anna de la Cruz, who shares some of that with her mother-in-law and her children. As Rowena's story demonstrates, one way to respond to the gap between rich and poor countries is to close it privately--by moving to a better paying job.Even as the gap between the globe's rich and poor grows wider, the globe itself--its capital, cultural images, consumer tastes, and peoples--becomes more integrated. Thanks to the spread of Western, and especially American, movies and television programs, the people of the poor south now know a great deal about the rich north. But what they learn about the north is what people <i>have,</i> in what often seems like a material striptease.Certainly, rising inequality and the lure of northern prosperity have contributed to what Stephen Castles and Mark Miller call a "globalization of migration."4 For men and women alike, migration has become a private solution to a public problem. Since 1945 and especially since the mid-1980s, a small but growing proportion of the world's population is migrating. They come from and go to more different countries. Migration is by no means an inexorable process, but as Castles and Miller observe, "migrations are growing in volume in all major regions at the present time."5 The International Organization for Migration estimates that 120 million people moved from one country to another, legally or illegally, in 1994. Of this group, about 2 percent of the world's population, 15 to 23 million are refugees and asylumseekers. Of the rest, some move to join family members who have previously migrated. But most move to find work.As a number of studies show, most migration takes place through personal contact with networks of migrants composed of relatives and friends and relatives and friends of relatives and friends. One migrant inducts another. Whole networks and neighborhoods leave to work abroad, bringing back stories, money, know-how, and contacts. Just as men form networks along which information about jobs are passed, so one domestic worker in New York, Dubai, or Paris passes on information to female relatives or friends about how to arrange papers, travel, find a job, and settle.Today, half of all the world's migrants are women. In Sri Lanka, one out of every ten citizens--a majority of them women--works abroad. That figure excludes returnees who have worked abroad in the past. As Castles and Miller explain:Women play an increasing role in all regions and all types of migration. In the past, most labor migrations and many refugee movements were male dominated, and women were often dealt with under the category of family reunion. Since the 1960s, women have played a major role in labor migration. Today women workers form the majority in movements as diverse as those of Cape Verdians to Italy, Filipinos to the Middle East and Thais to Japan.6Of these female workers, a great many migrate to fill domestic jobs. Demand for domestic servants has risen both in developed countries, where it had nearly vanished, and in fast-growing economies such as Hong Kong and Singapore, where, write Miller and Castles, "immigrant servants--from the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Korea and Sri Lanka--allow women in the richer economies to take up new employment opportunities."7Vastly more middle-class women in the First World do paid work now than in the past. They work longer hours for more months a year and more years. So they need help caring for the family.8 In the United States in 1950, 15 percent of mothers of children aged six and under did paid work while 65 percent of such women do today. Seventy-two percent of all American women now work. Among them are the grandmothers and sisterswho thirty years ago might have stayed home to care for the children of relatives. Just as Third World grandmothers may be doing paid care work abroad in the Third World, so more grandmothers are working in the First World too--another reason First World families are looking outside the family for good care.Women who want to succeed in a professional or managerial job in the First World thus face strong pressures at work. Most careers are still based on a well-known (male) pattern: doing professional work, competing with fellow professionals, getting credit for work, building a reputation, doing it while you are young, hoarding scarce time, and minimizing family work by finding someone else to do it. In the past, the professional was a man; the "someone else" was his wife. The wife oversaw the family, itself a flexible, preindustrial institution concerned with human experiences the workplace excluded: birth, child rearing, sickness, death. Today, a growing "care industry" has stepped into the traditional wife's role, creating a very real demand for migrant women.But if First World middle-class women are building careers that are molded according to the old male model, by putting in long hours at demanding jobs, their nannies and other domestic workers suffer a greatly exaggerated version of the same thing. Two women working for pay is not a bad idea. But two working mothers giving their all to work is a good idea gone haywire. In the end, both First and Third World women are small players in a larger economic game whose rules they have not written.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The trends outlined above--global polarization, increasing contact, and the establishment of transcontinental female networks--have caused more women to migrate. They have also changed women's motives for migrating. Fewer women move for "family reunification" and more move in search of work. And when they find work, it is often within the growing "care sector," which, according to the economist Nancy Folbre, currently encompasses 20 percent of all American jobs.9A good number of the women who migrate to fill these positions seem to be single mothers. After all, about a fifth of the world's households are headed by women: 24 percent in the industrial world, 19 percent in Africa, 18 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and 13 percent in Asia andthe Pacific. Some such women are on their own because their husbands have left them or because they have escaped abusive marriages. In addition to these single mothers, there is also a shadow group of "almost" single mothers, only nominally married to men who are alcoholics, gamblers, or just too worn down by the hardships of life to make a go of it. For example, one Filipina nanny now working in California was married to a man whose small business collapsed as a result of overseas competition. He could find no well-paid job abroad that he found acceptable, so he urged his wife to "go and earn good money" as a lap dancer in a caf� in Japan. With that money, he hoped to restart his business. Appalled by his proposal, she separated from him to become a nanny in the United States.Many if not most women migrants have children. The average age of women migrants into the United States is twenty-nine, and most come from countries, such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, where female identity centers on motherhood, and where the birth rate is high. Often migrants, especially the undocumented ones, cannot bring their children with them. Most mothers try to leave their children in the care of grandmothers, aunts, and fathers, in roughly that order. An orphanage is a last resort. A number of nannies working in rich countries hire nannies to care for their own children back home either as solo caretakers or as aides to the female relatives left in charge back home. Carmen Ronquillo, for example, migrated from the Philippines to Rome to work as a maid for an architect and single mother of two. She left behind her husband, two teenagers--and a maid.10Whatever arrangements these mothers make for their children, however, most feel the separation acutely, expressing guilt and remorse to the researchers who interview them. Says one migrant mother who left her two-month-old baby in the care of a relative, "The first two years I felt like I was going crazy. You have to believe me when I say that it was like I was having intense psychological problems. I would catch myself gazing at nothing, thinking about my child."11 Recounted another migrant nanny through tears, "When I saw my children again, I thought, 'Oh children do grow up even without their mother.' I left my youngest when she was only five years old. She was already nine when I saw her again, but she still wanted me to carry her."12Many more migrant female workers than migrant male workers stay in their a...</p><h2>McGuffey Progressive Speller - HB</h2><p>Mott Media has Republished the 1830&#39;s Version of the McGuffey Readers with the Original Christian Content!

He was bound for a New Jersey dueling ground to settle his bitter dispute with Aaron Burr. Hamilton took just two men with him: his &#x201c;second&#x201d; for the duel, and Dr. David Hosack.</p><p>As historian Victoria Johnson reveals in her groundbreaking biography, Hosack was one of the few points the duelists did agree on. Summoned that morning because of his role as the beloved Hamilton family doctor, he was also a close friend of Burr. A brilliant surgeon and a world-class botanist, Hosack&#x2015;who until now has been lost in the fog of history&#x2015;was a pioneering thinker who shaped a young nation.</p><p>Born in New York City, he was educated in Europe and returned to America inspired by his newfound knowledge. He assembled a plant collection so spectacular and diverse that it amazes botanists today, conducted some of the first pharmaceutical research in the United States, and introduced new surgeries to American. His tireless work championing public health and science earned him national fame and praise from the likes of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander von Humboldt, and the Marquis de Lafayette.</p><p>One goal drove Hosack above all others: to build the Republic&#x2019;s first botanical garden. Despite innumerable obstacles and near-constant resistance, Hosack triumphed when, by 1810, his Elgin Botanic Garden at last crowned twenty acres of Manhattan farmland. &#x201c;Where others saw real estate and power, Hosack saw the landscape as a pharmacopoeia able to bring medicine into the modern age&#x201d; (Eric W. Sanderson, author of <em>Mannahatta</em>). Today what remains of America&#x2019;s first botanical garden lies in the heart of midtown, buried beneath Rockefeller Center.</p><p>Whether collecting specimens along the banks of the Hudson River, lecturing before a class of rapt medical students, or breaking the fever of a young Philip Hamilton, David Hosack was an American visionary who has been too long forgotten. Alongside other towering figures of the post-Revolutionary generation, he took the reins of a nation. In unearthing the dramatic story of his life, Johnson offers a lush depiction of the man who gave a new voice to the powers and perils of nature.</p> 16 pages of color illustrations</p><p>Victoria Johnson is an associate professor of urban policy and planning at Hunter College of the City University of New York, where she teaches on the history of New York City. She has been a Cullman Fellow at the New York Public Library and a Mellon Visiting Scholar at the New York Botanical Garden.&#x201c;If Rockefeller Center is haunted, a likely candidate for the ghost is David Hosack, the doctor-botanist who assembled a major plant collection on the site starting in 1801.... Victoria Johnson&#x2019;s <em>American Eden</em> unearths Hosack, who was lauded in his lifetime but largely forgotten since. Hosack&#x2019;s Columbia lectures were, as one student said, &#x201c;as good as the theater,&#x201d; and so is Johnson&#x2019;s storytelling. She weaves his biography with threads of history &#x2015; political, medical and scientific &#x2015; and the tale of an up-and-coming New York City. An innovative medical practitioner, he was the friend and doctor Hamilton and Burr had in attendance on that July morning along the Weehawken cliffs for their ill-starred duel. Did Lin-Manuel Miranda&#x2019;s <em>Hamilton</em> leave you with an appetite for more? <em>American Eden</em> will not disappoint.... In her ambitious and entertaining book Johnson connects past to present. David Hosack&#x2019;s garden may have been short-lived, but in our parks, gardens, medical practices and pharmacology, his efforts continue to bear fruit.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marta McDowell, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] captivating biography... Along the way, [Victoria Johnson] restores this attractive polymath&#x2015;who today is mainly remembered, thanks to a small role in a certain hip-hop musical, as the doctor-in-attendance at the 1804 duel between two of his patients, Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton &#x2015;to his rightful place in American history. The rescue from oblivion is long overdue.... Johnson, an associate professor of urban planning at Hunter College and an authority on botanic gardens, never allows her subject&#x2019;s many achievements to weigh down her narrative. She writes trippingly, with engaging fluency and wit. She has a lovely way of conjuring up early New York and its denizens&#x2015;the workers calling out as they unload cargo at the docks; the gentlemen crowding into the Tontine Coffee House for the news of the day. The book&#x2019;s botany-related passages are particularly vivid. The author writes of plants delightedly, precisely&#x2015;as Hosack himself might have done.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Penelope Rowlands, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lucky is the biographer who can resurrect a forgotten figure and retrieve a major reputation lost to the passage of time. In this captivating and intensely readable book, Victoria Johnson rescues the remarkable life of Dr. David Hosack, physician and botanist extraordinaire and a towering benefactor of New York and the early republic. A welcome achievement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Ron Chernow, author of <em>Grant</em> and <em>Alexander Hamilton</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lively.... Victoria Johnson follows Hosack&#x2019;s life and legacy through a range of detail and social context which answers all the answerable questions. Evocations of &#x2018;pastoral Manhattan&#x2019; run through the story, reminding us what has been concreted over and lost.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Robin Lane Fox, <i>Financial Times</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>American Eden</em> is one of those rare books...it surprises by its originality, it impresses with its deep scholarship and it seduces with its beautiful writing. Victoria Johnson has the gift of a storyteller and the tenacity of a detective...her descriptions of medicine, botany and politics in the early Republic are not only compelling but also exquisitely researched.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrea Wulf, author of <em>The Invention of Nature: Alexander von Humboldt's New World</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve listened to <em>Hamilton</em>, you devoured the Alexander Hamilton biography. But you might not have read up on David Hosack, the American botanist and doctor who accompanied Hamilton and Burr on their fateful duel. While he wasn&#x2019;t paid in advance, he was treated with civility, and in <em>American Eden: David Hosack, Botany, and Medicine in the Garden of the Early Republic</em>, you can read more about his life as a pioneering botanist, pharmacologist, and surgeon.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mary Beth Griggs, <i>Popular Science</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;In the fall of 1797 the eldest son of Alexander Hamilton, Philip, fell ill with yellow fever, which was sweeping through New York City. The family doctor, David Hosack, employed an unorthodox treatment of hot baths of Peruvian bark and alcohol and saved the boy's life... Hosack went on to establish the nation's first botanical garden&#x2015;the Elgin Botanic Garden&#x2015;in the place that is now Rockefeller Center and to launch the American era of botany. He used the Elgin collection to conduct some of the earliest methodical research on the medicinal properties of plants, including poppies from which opiates are derived and the two plants that would later be involved in the development of aspirin.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Andrea Gawrylewski, <i>Scientific American</i> [Editors' Book Recommendations]</strong><br><br>&#x201c;[David Hosack] became a titan of medical research in the fledgling nation. He published on tetanus and breast cancer, pioneered smallpox vaccination and, as Victoria Johnson&#x2019;s fine science biography reveals, contributed vastly to medicinal botany. Hosack&#x2019;s famed, now lost, Elgin Botanic Garden in New York City became a key training centre for scientists and surgeons, who peered "into the globe-spanning, dizzying complexity of the natural world" through plants. A rich and compelling read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara Kiser, <i>Nature</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Victoria Johnson's <em>American Eden</em> is the kind of history I love: deeply researched, evocative of its time, and fascinating at every turn. It follows the life of David Hosack, early American doctor, botanist, New Yorker, and bon vivant, whose life touched the famous on both sides of the Atlantic. Hosack was there when Alexander Hamilton took a bullet; Hosack greeted the Marquis de Lafayette on his triumphal return in 1824; Hosack founded North America's first botanic garden on the land where Rockefeller Center now stands in midtown Manhattan. Where others saw real estate and power, Hosack saw the landscape as a pharmocopeia able to bring medicine into the modern age.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eric W. Sanderson, author of <em>Mannahatta: A Natural History of New York City</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>American Eden</em> is an exhaustively researched, brilliant and lively biography set in the close political, social and intellectual circles of the new Republic by professor of urban planning Victoria Johnson... Johnson's storytelling skills and her thorough knowledge of the period and the science makes this a book that will appeal to history lovers, botanists and gardeners alike.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sara Catterall, <i>Shelf Awareness</i></strong></p><h2>Johnny Texas</h2><p>In the early days of Texas history, ten-year-old Johann comes from Germany with his family to settle in this vast land and soon grows to love his new home.</p><p></p><h2>Shopping for Porcupine: A Life in Arctic Alaska</h2><p>His story begins with the arrival of his father, Howard Kantner, to the remote Arctic of the 1950s and ends with him as a grown man settled in the same landscape. Through a series of moving essays and vivid photographs, ranging in subject from family histories to hunting stories, celebrations of people and places to a lament over a majestic wilderness rapidly disappearing, <i>Shopping for Porcupine</i> provides a compelling, intimate view of America&#x2019;s last frontier the same place that captivated so many readers of <i>Ordinary Wolves.</i></p><p>"Fascinating essays, marvelous photographs. As he did with his remarkable novel, <i>Ordinary Wolves</i>, Seth Kantner illuminates an Alaska most of us will never know." Andrea Barrett<br><br>"This book is full of stunning images, and only some of them are in the photos. Others are in the narrative accounts of traditions colliding, subsistences overlapping, dilemmas mounting. It's all quite unforgettable." Bill McKibben<br><br>"One of the most beautiful books you'll ever read--truthful, raw, and lovely. The photographs make the sparse arctic Alaskan landscape monumentally visible and profound, while Kantner's writing imparts heroic dignity to the lives around him. From a childhood spent in a time when 'Frostbite was a way of life' to an adulthood fiercely lived, the tale of this man's life is original and funny, vivid and touching. As tough as caribou hide, Kantner enthralls the reader from beginning to end. This book is bound to become a classic alongside the works of Loren Eiseley, Edward Abbey, and John McPhee." Jonis Agee<br><br>"With <i>Ordinary Wolves</i>, Seth Kantner came streaking up out of the Arctic tundra like a blazing meteor in reverse. If it isn't the best novel to come out of Alaska so far, I don't know what is. Now, with his new collection of autobiographical vignettes and photographs, we get a closer look at the unique upbringing that informs that fine work. He brings us into the wildest scenes as only someone of this place can do. For all the popularity of the recent best sellers and hit movies about Alaska, <i>Shopping for Porcupine</i> comes from a place you haven't seen yet and can hardly imagine." Dan O'Neill<br><br>"<i>Shopping For Porcupine</i> brings the searing honesty, lyric style, and raw emotional power we've come to anticipate from this home-grown Alaska prodigy. In <i>Ordinary Wolves</i>, you glimpsed Seth Kantner's life between the words. Here, you meet it head-on." Nick Jans*Starred Review* Kantner&#x2019;s gripping first book, the novel Ordinary Wolves (2004), embodied a unique perspective on Alaskan life. Now the Whiting Award&#x2013;winning&nbsp;author shares true stories of his own tundra experiences in a book of bracing essays and beautiful photographs. The son of intrepid, back-to-the-land free spirits from Ohio, Kantner, born in an igloo in 1965, dreamed of becoming a great hunter in the Eskimo tradition, but most&nbsp;Inupiaq&nbsp;eagerly embraced mainstream American culture and technology. Indeed, paradox and loss abound in Kantner&#x2019;s riveting and provocative tales of hunting caribou and moose, and in his poignant profiles of elders with vast knowledge of the tundra who are being displaced by&nbsp;the results of climate change, from rising seas to melting permafrost and treacherously thin ice. Suspense and heartache are matched by wry humor and outrage, and all is infused with Kantner&#x2019;s humility and deep respect for the wild as he decries the practices of&nbsp;high-tech trophy hunters, and maps his&nbsp;own metamorphosis from trapper and hunter to writer and photographer. Crafted with the precision and nerve acquired by living&nbsp;off the land,&nbsp;this is a powerful and important book of remembrance, protest, and warning. --Donna Seaman</p><h2>Experimental Drawing, 30th Anniversary Edition: Creative Exercises Illustrated by Old and New Masters</h2><p><b>Stimulating exercises to help beginner to advanced students push the boundaries of traditional drawing.</b><br><br>As with most art forms, it's best to comprehend traditional drawing techniques before you break the rules.

According to Katherine Dunn, author of the cult classic <b>Geek Love</b>, Portland is the home of America&#x2019;s &#x201c;fugitives and refugees.&#x201d; Get to know these folks, the &#x201c;most cracked of the crackpots,&#x201d; as Palahniuk calls them, and come along with him on an adventure through the parts of Portland you might not otherwise believe actually exist. No other travel guide will give you this kind of access to &#x201c;a little history, a little legend, and a lot of friendly, sincere, fascinating people who maybe should&#x2019;ve kept their mouths shut.&#x201d;<br><br>Here are strange personal museums, weird annual events, and ghost stories. Tour the tunnels under downtown Portland. Visit swingers&#x2019; sex clubs, gay and straight. See Frances Gabe&#x2019;s famous 1940s Self-Cleaning House. Look into strange local customs like the I-Tit-a-Rod Race and the Santa Rampage. Learn how to talk like a local in a quick vocabulary lesson. Get to know, I mean really get to know, the animals at the Portland zoo. <br><br>Oh, the list goes on and on.</p><p>It's rare to find a travel guide and a memoir joined neatly together in a single, highly readable 176-page volume. But Chuck Palahniuk (<i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Choke</i>, <i>Lullaby</i>) is a writer of rare talent and his home of Portland, Oregon, is a city of rare wonders. In <i>Strangers and Refugees: A Walk in Portland, Oregon</i>, Palahniuk goes beyond the AAA handbooks to reveal the places, people, and legends of Portland that have long been known only to locals. The reader learns the location of the legendary Self Cleaning House, where to find the restless ghost of the founder of Powell's Books, and why feral cats are such an important part of Portland baseball. Portland, it seems, is also a highly sexual city and Palahniuk dutifully dissects the specialties of each strip joint as well as discussing Mochika, a zoo penguin with a real fetish for black boots. Along the way, he includes "postcards" from his life in the Rose City dating back to 1981 when, as a 19-year-old, he dropped acid and accidentally ate part of a woman's fur coat during a laser show of Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i>. As Palahniuk matures, the postcards reveal the author becoming increasingly a part of the city's scene, culminating with a wild and wooly Millennium Eve celebration at the Bagdad Theater that featured a screening of the film version of <i>Fight Club</i>. <i>Fugitives and Refugees</i> is a must for anyone who may, in their lives, go to Portland. But its appeal should reach beyond Oregonians. Palahniuk's love of the city is so great, and his stories so weirdly wonderful, it makes one want to get out of the house, get in the car, and drive to Portland right away. Just remember to pack the book. <i>--John Moe</i>CHUCK PALAHNIUK is the author of six novels, including the bestsellers <b>Fight Club</b>, <b>Choke</b>, and <b>Lullaby</b>.

Not now. Not after that.<br> <br>The baby twisted to watch his mother&#x2019;s long, squash-colored skirts swirl then vanish through the door. Minty struggled to keep her balance. Charles reached his fat arms toward the door, and Minty almost dropped him. None of the babies in the slave cabins was this fleshy! She sat down so she could hold him tight in her lap.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; she gasped. The floor felt soft through Minty&#x2019;s thin cotton shift. She rubbed her bare feet on fabric as fuzzy as a bumblebee&#x2019;s backside. The baby giggled with the movement. Minty glanced at the edge of the floor and blinked. It wasn&#x2019;t made of packed dirt at all, but wooden boards, cut flat and melted together somehow. She stared.<br> <br>Charles whimpered. &#x201c;Hush-a-baby,&#x201d; she tried to calm him. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;all be good, now, you hear?&#x201d; The baby looked up at her. The air was so hot that her black skin and his white were stuck together with summer sweat, but when she looked into those sky-colored eyes, she shivered. Charles looked about to cry, so Minty kept talking. &#x201c;Hush, pretty baby.&#x201d; She made her voice soft and happy-sounding. &#x201c;This child here, she don&#x2019; want a whipping,&#x201d; she babbled, &#x201c;nohow, I don&#x2019;t. No, sir. No, sir.&#x201d; She pictured her older brother&#x2019;s back, bruised and bleeding after a lashing. Then she thought about her father&#x2019;s back, crisscrossed with old scars. She remembered the sound of her sister, screaming in pain. Then she made herself stop thinking.<br> <br>Suddenly the baby&#x2019;s fat little hand was pushing at her lips. He was trying to stick his pink finger into her mouth! &#x201c;What you want, baby?&#x201d; she asked. Charles smiled. &#x201c;You like my talking?&#x201d; Now he grinned, showing little baby teeth as white as his soft gown. &#x201c;I can sing for you, too, I reckon.&#x201d; The baby waved his arms. &#x201c;Oh, Go down, Moses,&#x201d; Minty sang. &#x201c;Way down in Egypt&#x2019;s land,&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She began rocking in time with the church hymn. &#x201c;Tell old Pharaoh, &#x2018;Let my people go.&#x2019; &#x201d; The child lay quiet on her lap. Minty smiled. I can do fine here, Minty thought, starting the next verse. I jus&#x2019; got to sing, and&#x2014;she swallowed hard&#x2014;and never, never drop this here baby.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;Give him here, Araminta.&#x201d; The sound of her new mistress&#x2019;s voice made Minty jump. Was it dinnertime already? Her stomach growled, and she struggled to her feet, handing Charles to his mother.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait outside, girl,&#x201d; Miss Susan said. &#x201c;When the meal is done we&#x2019;ll feed you and the dogs.&#x201d; Shocked, Minty hurried toward the door. &#x201c;Not that one!&#x201d; the tone in Miss Susan&#x2019;s voice put a chill down her neck. &#x201c;Use the servants&#x2019; door, back behind the brooms and buckets.&#x201d; There were two doors in this house? Slave cabins had only one, and no windows, either. Minty scurried through room after room, toward the back of the house. She didn&#x2019;t have to ask what would happen if she used the wrong door.<br> <br>The floor under her feet had soft cloth on it. Minty couldn&#x2019;t help it. She slowed down to shuffle across the strange smoothness. There were clothes on everything. She looked into a room. The table had a dress on it. The windows wore dresses, too, with ruffles. Minty smiled. Little tables wore scarves with fringe. The chairs were dressed in fuzzy, colored cloth. Minty wanted to rub her hands on all of it.<br> <br>The walls were as flat as the floor, and all dressed in stripes and roses. And the ceiling? She stopped in wonder. The ceiling was as white as Miss Susan! Where did the cooking smoke go? Minty sniffed. The air was empty. No friendly smell of food cooking on the fire. No smell of family bodies all together and sweaty. No smell of wood from log cabin walls. No smell of home at all. Just the breeze off the ocean, scented with salt and the sharp tang of low tide in the marshes. A gull cried, lonely in the distance.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out, girl!&#x201d; Miss Susan stamped her foot against the wood floor. Minty jumped and ran. The white woman&#x2019;s laughter chased her out of the house.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;Now, Minty.&#x201d; Miss Susan stood in the lamplight next to the bed. She stretched her arms wide and yawned. Minty stared. No one she knew had so many teeth. And no one wore a pretty dress to bed. This one was pale pink, with tiny flowers stitched around the edges. &#x201c;My sister is coming tomorrow,&#x201d; Miss Susan said. &#x201c;I need my rest tonight.&#x201d; Minty looked down at the baby lying on a soft pink pillow in a cradle beside the bed. &#x201c;Keep Charles quiet, so I can sleep.&#x201d;<br> <br>Miss Susan blew the lantern out, lay down on the bed, and pulled snowy white sheets over her dress.<br> <br>Minty sat down beside the baby and began singing to him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Quiet,&#x201d; Miss Susan growled in the darkness over her head.<br> <br>Minty hummed as quietly as she could.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hush your mouth!&#x201d; Miss Susan scolded. &#x201c;Girl, I&#x2019;ve got a switch up here, and you know I&#x2019;ll use it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Minty blinked back tears and reached her hand out to rock the little cradle. At home, Mama would be saying night prayers over everyone resting on the floor. Papa would say a verse from the Bible to sleep on, and the day would be done. Minty said a prayer now, but silently. Soon the only sounds were Miss Susan&#x2019;s snores. Starlight washed in through the glass of the windows, softening the shadows in the room. Minty yawned and settled against the wall, her hand still pushing the cradle, back and forth, again and again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wanh!&#x201d; Charles&#x2019;s cry woke Minty just before the lash whistled down toward her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ow!&#x201d; she cried, startled by the sound, the moonlight in the room, and the sudden pain along the back of her neck. &#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; she cried as the switch fell on her again.<br> <br>&#x201c;You stupid girl!&#x201d; Miss Susan&#x2019;s voice was as sharp as the pain itself. &#x201c;Rock the baby!&#x201d;<br> <br>Rock, rock, rock, Minty&#x2019;s hand moved the cradle. Little Charles hiccuped himself back to sleep again. Miss Susan&#x2019;s snores were louder now. Mama! Minty wanted to cry. Mama! She felt a trickle dripping down her neck, but kept rocking the cradle. The moon was staring at her full in the face through the window. She yawned. Stay awake, she scolded herself. But how? Minty sang in her head all the church songs she knew, rocking the cradle in time to the music that only she heard. Then she sang all the songs again. She didn&#x2019;t remember losing her place before she jerked awake again at Charles&#x2019;s groggy whimper.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thwack!&#x201d; The lash fell, harder this time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, miss, sorry,&#x201d; Minty begged, but the lash silenced even this.<br> <br>The moon moved past the window, and darkness filled the bedroom again. Presently the faintest dawn woke a distant rooster. The stars winked out, one by one, beyond the glass. Minty&#x2019;s head was nodding when Miss Susan finally sat up and stretched. &#x201c;Get up, you lazy thing,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to get to work.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Ancient Roman World (The World in Ancient Times)</h2><p>Beginning with the founding of Rome, each chapter features important figures- including Julius Caesar, Augustus, and Hadrian to discuss the evolution of the republic, Greek influences, and rise of Christianity.

She was liberated from the concentration camp Bergau by the Red Cross and then volunteered to teach sewing to fellow displaced women. She is known for her memoir <i>The Seamstress: A Memoir of Survival.&nbsp;</i>A striking Holocaust memoir, posthumously published, by a Romanian Jew with an unusual story to tell. From its opening pages, in which she recounts her own premature birth, triggered by terrifying rumors of an incipient pogrom, Bernstein's tale is clearly not a typical memoir of the Holocaust. She was born into a large family in rural Romania between the wars and grew up feisty and willing to fight back physically against anti-Semitism from other schoolchildren. She defied her father's orders to turn down a scholarship that took her to Bucharest, and got herself expelled from that school when she responded to a priest/teacher's vicious diatribe against the Jews by hurling a bottle of ink at him. Ashamed to return home after her expulsion, she looked for work in Bucharest and discovered a talent for dressmaking. That talent--and her blond hair, blue eyes, and overall Gentile appearance--allowed her entry into the highest reaches of Romanian society, albeit as a dressmaker. Bernstein recounts the growing shadow of the native fascist movement, the Iron Guard, a rising tide of anti-Semitic laws, and finally, the open persecution of Romania's Jews. After a series of incidents that ranged from dramatic escapes to a year in a forced labor detachment, Sara ended up in Ravensbr ck, a women's concentration camp deep in Germany. Nineteen out of every twenty women transported there died. The author, her sister Esther, and two other friends banded together and, largely due to Sara's extraordinary street smarts and intuition, managed to survive. Although Bernstein was not a professional writer, she tells this story with style and power. Her daughter Marlene contributes a moving epilogue to close out Sara's life. One of the best of the recent wave of Holocaust memoirs. (b&amp;w photos, not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Central to the menu are soups.<br><br>Inspired by the traditions of cucina povera, the so-called &#x201c;cuisine of the poor&#x201d; that has been the source of so many brilliant Italian dishes, Talbott&#x2019;s recipes waste nothing, employ the concept of arrangiarsi (&#x201c;making do&#x201d;), and skillfully transform leftovers. And, in another nod to the wisdom and economy of traditional kitchens, she also points out which soups can easily be made into one-dish meals with the addition of a single ingredient such as a poached egg, a piece of grilled toast, or even clams. <br><br>Organized seasonally, <i>Zuppe</i> also serves as a practical guide to using the bounty of farmers markets throughout the year.</p><p>Mona Talbott was chosen by Alice Waters to be the Executive Chef of the Rome Sustainable Food Project in 2006.

Photography historian Alison Gernsheim first studied Victorian and Edwardian fashion in order to be able to date photographs in her collection. Of course the photos soon proved to be the best of all fashion plates &#x2014; authentic, detailed, as decorative and charming as top fashion illustration. When united with identifications and descriptions of the chief costume articles, and a commentary that includes childhood memories of the period, the resulting history is doubly indispensable &#x2014; equally useful and delightful to serious and casual readers.<br>The invention of photography preceded that of the crinoline by about a decade. Pre-crinoline bonnets, stovepipe hats, and deep d�colletage are featured in the first of these 235 illustrations &#x2014; including a beautiful 1840 daguerreotype portrait of a lady that is the earliest study of its kind extant. From 1855 to the 1870s the crinoline gave shape (whether barrel, bell, teapot, or otherwise) to English women, and their shapes fill many of these full and half-page photos. English men went beardless in top hats and frock coats; as in other eras, the sporting wear of the previous generation became acceptable morning and evening town attire. Styles and accoutrements came and went &#x2014; moustaches, straw hats, bustles and bodice line, petticoats, corsets, shawls and falsies, flounces, ruffles, lace, and materials &#x2014; satin, silk, velvet, woolen underwear, full-length sable, and osprey feathers. Many of the models for these fashions were already fashionable enough &#x2014; Oscar Wilde, Aubrey Beardsley, Lillie Langtry, Winston Churchill, many archdukes, duchesses, counts, princes, and Queen Victoria herself. Photographers are identified where possible, and include Nadar, Lewis Carroll, and the Downeys. Every photograph is captioned and annotated.</p><p>A former commercial photographer, Helmut Gernsheim (1913-95) ranks among the most influential and prolific historians of photography. He virtually created the academic study of photography in the 1940s, carrying out extensive research and amassing a priceless collection of historical prints. His books remain authoritative resources on the development of photography.</p><h2>Children and Families in the Social Environment: Modern Applications of Social Work</h2><p><p>The first edition of this volume successfully applied Bronfenbrenner&#x2019;s &#x201c;micro-systems&#x201d; taxonomy to childrearing and family life. Emphasizing how forces in the environment influence children&#x2019;s behavior, Garbarino has staked out an intermediate position between the psychoanalytic and the systems approach to human development. Taking cognizance of new research and of changes in American society, Garbarino has once again carefully analyzed the importance of children&#x2019;s social relationships. For this wholly revised second edition, he has incorporated a greater emphasis on ethnic, cultural, and racial issues.</p></p><p><p>"[T]he book is an extraordinary resource for researchers, policy makers, and practitioners concerned with identifying and developing ways of working with communities to enhance understanding of and service to the diverse children and families of the United States."</p> <p>&#x2014;<em>Contemporary Psychology </em></p></p><h2>Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet</h2><p>This book is a comprehensive guide to the International Phonetic Alphabet, widely used for over a century to transcribe the sounds of languages. The Handbook is in three parts: Part I contains an introduction to phonetic description and exemplification of the use of phonetic symbols; Part II consists of twenty-nine &#34;Illustrations&#34; of the application of the International Phonetic Alphabet to a range of languages; and Part III covers speech pathology, computer codings, and the history of the IPA.

Many in their Plymouth colony won't make it through the winter, and the colony's first harvest is possible only with the help of two friends, Samoset and Squanto.<br> <br>Richly detailed paintings show how the pilgrims lived after landing at Plymouth, through the dark winter and into the busy days of spring, summer, and fall. Culminating with the excitement of the original Thanksgiving feast, <i>Three Young Pilgrims</i> makes history come alive.</p><p>Cheryl Harness lives in Independence, Missouri. As an author and illustrator, she is known for her engaging approach to history, seen in such books as <i>Our Colonial Year</i>; <i>Mary Walker Wears the Pants</i>;<i> Young Abe Lincoln</i>;<i> George Washington</i>;<i> Spymaster</i>; <i>Three Young Pilgrims, Ghosts of the White House</i>; and <i>Remember the Ladies.</i>Using the lives of three real children who traveled on the Mayflower and lived in the Plymouth Colony--Mary, Remember and Bartholomew Allerton--Harness focuses on their experiences and "adventures during one year, between the autumns of 1620 and 1621." She surrounds their story with the larger one of the Pilgrims' struggle for religious freedom and human survival, and invests these figures from the past with a vitality and accessibility that transcend the customary seasonal emphases. This is no sanitized interpretation: the death of the children's mother and her new baby is included, as are the illnesses and deaths of many of the other "Saints"--Pilgrims--and "strangers"--non-religious members of the settlement party. Nor is the historical information here confined to the well-paced, involving text; equally effective are the carefully researched watercolor, gouache and colored pencil paintings--possessed of a suitable rusticity, they expand the narrative with dramatic intensity. A generous inclusion of diagrams, charts and maps abounds with the kind of details and labels capable of mesmerizing youngsters for hours. This notable blend of fact and fiction deserves year-round popularity.

One of the most effective ways to help students explore its vitality is through primary sources. <em>American Religions: A Documentary History</em> is the only one-volume, up-to-date collection of primary sources available for American religious history courses. Featuring a creative dual structure--the readings are arranged both chronologically and thematically--this indispensable sourcebook can be used in both historically and topically organized courses.<br> Balancing canonical works with those by newly discovered voices, <em>American Religions: A Documentary History</em> includes seventy-five classic and contemporary selections from the colonial period through the present day. It offers readings by a uniquely wide range of religiously, socially, and ethnically diverse writers: theological conservatives and liberals, northerners and southerners, women and men, and African Americans and Mexican Americans alongside Anglo-Americans. The selections are long enough to stimulate serious discussion yet concise enough for students to digest easily. The volume is organized into six sections that cover different chronological periods, each of which contains writings on five themes: theological reflections, ritual and performance, spiritual autobiography, interreligious conflict and negotiation, and more expansive conceptualizations of religion. Enhanced by brief biographies of the authors, a general introduction, and section introductions, the text also includes two sample syllabi--one oriented toward a historical approach and the other toward a thematic approach. Ideal for introductory courses in religion in America and American religious history--taught both in religious studies and history departments--<em>American Religions: A Documentary History</em> offers students a broad yet in-depth and engaging gateway into the subject.<br></p><p>R.

In these three lectures, originally delivered in somewhat different form as The Raymond Fred West Memorial Lectures at Stanford University in May 1963, Dr. Heschel inquires into the logic of being human: What is meant by being human? What are the grounds on which to justify a human being&#x2019;s claim to being human?<br>In the author&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;We have never been as openmouthed and inquisitive, never as astonished and embarrassed at our ignorance about man. We know what he makes, but we do not konw wha he is or what to expect of him. Is it not conceivable that our entire civilization is built upon a minsinterpretation of man? Or that the tragedy of man is due to the fact that he is a being who has forgotten the question: Who is Man? The failure to identify himself, to know what is authentic human existence, leads him to assume a false identity, to pretending to be what he is unable to be or to not accepting what is at the very root of his being. Ignorance about man is not lack of knowledge, but false knowledge.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>Theoretical Perspectives for Direct Social Work Practice, Third Edition: A Generalist-Eclectic Approach</h2><p><b>Praise for Previous Edition:</b><p><i>Finally, a social work practice text that makes a difference!

But in <i>The Biology of Desire</i>, cognitive neuroscientist and former addict Marc Lewis makes a convincing case that addiction is not a disease, and shows why the disease model has become an obstacle to healing.<br><br>Lewis reveals addiction as an unintended consequence of the brain doing what it's supposed to do-seek pleasure and relief-in a world that's not cooperating. As a result, most treatment based on the disease model fails. Lewis shows how treatment can be retooled to achieve lasting recovery. This is enlightening and optimistic reading for anyone who has wrestled with addiction either personally or professionally.<br><br></p><p><b>Marc Lewis, PhD,</b> is a neuroscientist and professor of developmental psychology. Now at Radboud University in the Netherlands, he taught for more than twenty years at the University of Toronto. He has authored or coauthored more than fifty journal articles in neuroscience and developmental psychology. Presently, he speaks and blogs on topics in addiction science, and his critically acclaimed book, <i>Memoirs of an Addicted Brain: A Neuroscientist Examines His Former Life on Drugs</i>, is the first to blend memoir and science in addiction studies.<br>Dr. Lewis... a former addict who recovered to become a distinguished neuroscientist and author ... writes engagingly about the addictive experience, the recovery experience and the science behind them. Whether you are looking for a foundation in the neuroscience of addiction, guidelines for recovery or just hope that recovery is possible, it's all here. The scientific information is presented in the context of day-to-day behavior and the lives of individuals you will come to care about. You'll learn more about neuroscience (and human development and psychology) than you may have thought possible. Informed by this book, you'll see how neuroscience explains addiction as a part of life, rather than a mysterious entity only experts can understand.<b>Tom Horvath, Ph.D., President of ABPP, Practical Recover, and SMART Recovery and author of <i>Sex, Drugs, Gambling &amp; Chocolate: A Workbook for Overcoming Addictions</i></b><br><br>Marc Lewis's new book neatly links current thinking about addiction with neuroscience theory and artfully selected biographies. Ex-addicts, we learn, are not 'cured'; rather they have become more connected to others, wiser, and more in touch with their own humanity. This is a hopeful message that has, as Lewis demonstrates, the advantage of also being true.<b>Gene Heyman, author of <i>Addiction: Disorder of Choice</i></b><br><br><br><i>The Biology of Desire</i> says a lot about the brain mechanisms underpinning addiction but, to its credit, does not stop there. With minor exceptions, we do not help addicts (and they do not help themselves) by ministering directly to their brains. As Mr. Lewis stresses throughout this unorthodox but enlightening book, people learn to be addicts, and, with effort, they can learn not to be addicts, too.<i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i><br><br>Informed by unparalleled neuroscientific insight and written with his usual flare, Marc Lewis's <i>The Biology of Desire </i>effectively refutes the medical view of addiction as a primary brain disease. A bracing and informative corrective to the muddle that now characterizes public and professional discourse on this topic.<b>Gabor Mat, M.D., author of <i>In The Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters With Addiction</i></b><br><br>Neuroscientist Lewis delves into the functioning of the addicted brain. He intends to demonstrate that addiction (substance abuse but also behavioral addictions such as eating disorders, gambling, etc.) is not a disease....This objective is met by the detailed life stories of five recovering addicts the author has interviewed. Their descent into the grips of addiction reads like passages of a junkie's memoir: terrifying and page-turning.... [T]his work helps make sense of how addiction operates and is recommended for readers wanting to learn more on the topic.<b><i>Library Journal</i></b></p><h2>Tales of King Arthur &amp; The Knights of the Round Table (Gothic Fantasy)</h2><p>An essential collection of chivalric romance, swordplay, wizardry and brutal feats of courage Malory&#x2019;s 15th century <i>Morte d&#x2019;Arthur</i> is one of the world&#x2019;s greatest pieces of myth-making, with most gothic and modern fantasy finding its roots in this splendid mix of history, magic and literature. This selected edition features many of Aubrey Beardsley&#x2019;s classic illustrations.</p><p><p>Sir Thomas Malory (fl. 1450&#x2013;1500) was an English writer and knight whose Le Morte D&#x2019;Arthur was the first prose piece dedicated to King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. Like the enchanting mystery of the legend of Arthur, Malory himself is a bit of a mystery. Though his identity is not certain, it is believed he wrote the famous &#x2018;Death of Arthur&#x2019; while imprisoned for violent crimes &#x2013; based partly on an inscription in the front of the original script begging readers to pray for his soul&#x2019;s deliverance, both in life and death. </p> <p>Aubrey Beardsley (1872&#x2013;98) had a short but influential artistic career. Before dying of tuberculosis, he created a series of drawings and prints in a short span of seven years that explored themes of decadence and symbolism, becoming a leading figure in Aestheticism and Art Nouveau. His sometimes gruesome images shocked his Victorian audience, but they remained particularly popular among English publishing houses for book illustration, the deluxe edition of Malory&#x2019;s Morte D&#x2019;Arthur being one example. </p> <p>Sarah Peverley is an award winning medievalist, cultural historian and BBC New Generation Thinker.

He lives in Watertown, Massachusetts.An absorbing account of a quarter century of conflict: the Apache resistance to the ``White Eye'' settlers encroaching on their Arizona lands. Clashes between US troops and Apaches broke out in 1861, but it was only after the Civil War that the army turned its attention fully to these skirmishes in the Southwest. Roberts (Jean Stafford: A Biography, 1988, etc.) sifts through contradictory memoirs and letters from the two sides to present a balanced version of why peace in the region was continually shattered--and why the outnumbered Apache were continually able to drive white settlers to hysteria. Complaints about Indian atrocities were sometimes valid, Roberts explains, but the Apache chief Cochise was often accused of crimes that he couldn't have committed. Meanwhile, the Apaches felt betrayed when agreements with troops were cavalierly broken by Indian land agents. Roberts's narrative is considerably enhanced by its briskly written portraits--including those of the fierce, and fiercely honest, Cochise; of General George Crook, the army's best Indian fighter, who found the key to ending the Apaches' flight (to catch an Apache, use Apache scouts); of John Clum, an Indian land agent whom the Apaches nicknamed ``Turkey Gobbler'' for his arrogance; Lozen, the woman warrior who could equal any man in riding and shooting; and Juh, the chief afflicted with a terrible stutter but gifted with military genius. And, above all, there is the presence of Geronimo, vengeful, untrustworthy, and vacillating, but also capable of leading a band of 34 men, women, and children that, before it surrendered in 1886, managed to elude five thousand American troops and another three thousand Mexican soldiers. Geronimo rightly feared the fate in store for his people: They were deported on sealed railroad cars to Florida, where they remained POWs for 27 years, never to see their homelands again. A history that never loses its sense of drama even as it separates myth from truth. (Sixteen pages of b&amp;w photographs--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But business enemies of the hydrofoil owner have stirred up a hornets&#x2019; nest of violent opposition among small boat owners. Fearing sabotage, he begs Frank and Joe Hardy to guard the <i>Flying Express</i> on her maiden trip. Startling developments plunge the teenage detectives into a dangerous chase by sea, air, and land in pursuit of a gang of hardened criminals who operate by the signs of the Zodiac. Tension mounts when the <i>Flying Express </i>vanishes &#x2013; and so does Sam Radley, Mr. Hardy&#x2019;s skilled operative. Peril stalks Frank and Joe&#x2019;s every moves as they hunt down the terrifying gangleader Zodiac Zig and his vicious henchmen.</p><p>Franklin W. Dixon is a pen name used by a variety of authors writing for the classic series, The Hardy Boys. The first and most well-known &#34;Franklin W. Dixon&#34; was Leslie McFarlane, a Canadian author who contributed 19 of the first 25 books in the series. Other writers who have adopted the pseudonym include Christopher Lampton, John Button, Amy McFarlane, and Harriet Stratemeyer Adams.</p><h2>The Chill</h2><p>In <i>The Chill </i>a distraught young man hires private investigator Lew Archer to track down his runaway bride. But no sooner has he found Dolly Kincaid than Archer finds himself entangled in two murders, one twenty years old, the other so recent that the blood is still wet. What ensues is a detective novel of nerve-racking suspense, desperately believable characters, and one of the most intricate plots ever spun by an American crime writer.</p><p>"The surprise with which a detective novel concludes should set up tragic vibrations which run backward through the entire structure," wrote Ross Macdonald in his 1981 <i>Self-Portrait</i>. Nowhere in his work does he better demonstrate this principle than in <i>The Chill</i>, first published in 1964. The plot is one of Macdonald's most masterfully constructed. Private detective Lew Archer is engaged to trace a missing spouse, who has vanished--apparently of her own free will--only a day into her honeymoon. Archer begins pulling at the threads of the case, and by page 25 they're already starting to reveal a deeper, darker story involving two murders 20 years apart. As usual, Macdonald's economical prose propels the reader forward from one action-packed scene to another, while the scenes in turn pile up to paint a rich, complex picture of buried memories, anguished relations between parents and children, the arrogance of the rich, and the search for identity. Then, at the end, one of the author's best surprise reversals changes the picture's colors entirely. Even if you're one of those discerning readers who find Macdonald's lesser work superior to most other mystery writing (as does this reviewer), <i>The Chill</i> stands out among his books. <i>--Nicholas H. Allison</i>"The American private eye, immortalized by Hammett, refined by Chandler, brought to its zenith by MacDonald." --<b>The New York Times Book Review</b><br><br>"An entertainment of almost Byzantine complexity in which practically nothing is as the facts would seem. . . . Highly satisfactory." --<b>The New Yorker</b><br><br>"Lew Archer . . . is a crime-fighter of the old school; painstakingly searching out the twisting thread of suspense that leads him from the hint of one complicated drama to another." --<b>Christian Science Monitor</b></p><h2>New Media in Art (World of Art)</h2><p><p><strong>Modern art, reflecting and defining new intellectual, scientific, and technological developments, has radically extended the conventional media of sculpture and painting.</strong></p> Following innovative ideas about representation and the free use of materials in cubism, futurism, and surrealism&#x2015;particularly in the work of Duchamp&#x2015;artists abandoned strict adherence to traditional hierarchies of media and embraced any means, including technological, which best served their purposes.

You want to shake the author and shout, 'Weren't you paying attention?' Jonathan L. Howard gets it right and offers a delightfully original (and non-Euclidean) twist on the mythos and H.P.

Paul Wilson, author of the Repairman Jack series, on Carter &amp; Lovecraft</i></p><p>&#x201c;Layer by layer, Howard deconstructs the Lovecraftian universe. His detective protagonist is plunged into the heart of a bloody mystery where every step forward brings him closer to doom, and where every revelation peels away the familiar, the known, and finally, all that is rational. <i>Carter &amp; Lovecraft </i>is a sleek, addicting horror novel that gleefully inverts and contradicts Mythos tropes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Laird Barron, author of The Beautiful Thing That Awaits Us All</i></p><p>&#x201c;In the cosmic darkness between Sam Spade and Dirk Gently, there's a nest of tentacles.

It would be easy at this point to say if you like Rankin or Fforde or Pratchett or Holt, then you will love these books, but while it may well be true it would be doing Howard a disservice.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Sci-Fi-London on the Johannes Cabal Series</i></p><p>&#x201c;Genre fans will appreciate Howard's attention to world building, while more general readers will simply enjoy all the horrific fun.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist on the Johannes Cabal Series</i></p><p>&#x201c;Howard's ear for witty banter and his skill at rendering black comedy bode well for the future.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly on the Johannes Cabal Series</i></p><p>&#x201c;Fans of the original Lovecraft will have their rewards ... but this series debut from Howard (Nightclubbing, 2015, etc.) shines brightest when keeping to his characters' easy banter and creepy deaths.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews on Carter &amp; Lovecraft</i></p><p>&#x201c;This refreshingly original novel updates the eldritch horrors of H.P.

Howard (the Brothers Cabal series) crafts a creepy mystery in which the mythos of H.P. Lovecraft is more fact than fiction. Carter is an endearing protagonist with a dark sense of humor and distaste for private eye clich�s. Emily Lovecraft resents her famous literary roots but becomes a spirited sidekick when her great-great-uncle's creations come to life. Together they make a formidable team and the solid foundation for a new series promised by <i>Carter &amp; Lovecraft</i>'s twist ending.

It also features a large portion of his essays and letters and an introduction by Wilde&#39;s son, Vyvyan Holland.</p><p>Born in Ireland in 1856, Oscar Wilde was a noted essayist, playwright, fairy tale writer and poet, as well as an early leader of the Aesthetic Movement. His plays include: <i>An Ideal Husband, Salome, A Woman of No Importance,</i> and <i>Lady Windermere's Fan.</i> Among his best known stories are <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> and <i>The Canterville Ghost</i>.<p>Chapter One</p><p><b>The Picture Of Dorian Gray</b></p><p>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.</p><p>From the corner of the divan of' Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flame-like as theirs ; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid jade-faced painters of Tokio who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive. The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ.</p><p>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement, and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.</p><p>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art, a smile of pleasure passed across his face, and seemed about to linger there. But he suddenly started up, and, closing his eyes, placed his fingers upon the lids, as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake.</p><p>"It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done," said Lord Henry, languidly. " You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse. The Grosvenor is really the only place."</p><p>"I don't think I shall send it anywhere," he answered, tossing his head back in that odd way that used to make his friends laugh at him at Oxford. " No : I won't send it anywhere."</p><p>Lord Henry elevated his eyebrows, and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such </p><p>fanciful whirls from his heavy opium-tainted cigarette. " Not send it anywhere ? My dear fellow, why ? Have you any reason ? What odd chaps you painters are ! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away. It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about. A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion."</p><p>"I know you will laugh at me," he replied, " but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it."</p><p>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed.</p><p>"Yes, I knew you would ; but it is quite true, all the same."</p><p>"Too much of yourself in it ! Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain ; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young</p><p>Adonis, who looks as if he was made out of ivory and rose-leaves. Why, my dear Basil, he is a Narcissus, and you-well, of course you have an intellectual expression, and all that. But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he a-ways looks absolutely delightful. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks. I feel quite sure of that. He is some brainless, beautiful creature, who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence. Don't flatter yourself, Basil : you are not in the least like him."</p><p>"You don't understand me, Harry," answered the artist. " O course I am not like him. I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him. You shrug your shoulders ? I am telling you the truth. There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world. They can sit at their ease and gape at the play.</p></p><h2>Mission Titanic (The 39 Clues: Doublecross, Book 1)</h2><p><p>At only seventeen years old, Ian Kabra is head of the Cahills, the most powerful family in the world.

Now, in <i>Buried Secrets</i>, Nick Heller returns, finding himself in the middle of a life-or-death situation that&#x2019;s both high-profile and intensely personal. <p></p>Nick has returned to his old home town of Boston to set up his own shop. There he&#x2019;s urgently summoned by an old family friend. Hedge fund titan Marshall Marcus desperately needs Nick&#x2019;s help. His teenaged daughter, Alexa, has just been kidnapped. Her abduction was clearly a sophisticated professional job, done with extraordinary precision. Alexa, whom Nick has known since she was young, is now buried alive, held prisoner in an underground crypt, a camera trained on her, her suffering streaming live over the internet. She&#x2019;s been left with a limited supply of food and water and, if her father doesn&#x2019;t meet the demands of her shadowy kidnappers, she&#x2019;ll die. And as Nick begins to probe, he discovers that all is not quite right with Marshall Marcus&#x2019;s business. He&#x2019;s being investigated by the FBI, he has a lot of shady investors, his fund is in danger and now he has a lot of powerful enemies who may have the motivation to go after Marcus&#x2019;s daughter. But to find out who&#x2019;s holding Alexa Marcus hostage, Nick has to find out why. Once he does, he uncovers an astonishing conspiracy that reaches far beyond anything he could have imagined. And if he&#x2019;s going to find Alexa in time, he will have to flush out and confront some of his deadliest opponents ever. <p></p> <br> <b>Amazon Exclusive: Reacher and Heller</b> <br> <b>by Lee Child, author of the bestselling Jack Reacher series</b> <p> </p><p>Some say it was Virginia and some say it was North Carolina but all agree it was a bar. Everyone was drinking domestic beer, except Reacher, who was drinking coffee, and inevitably after an hour the talk turned to guys people knew. Reacher sat quiet, not really part of the group, content to ignore the war stories and the tall tales, until the name Nick Heller came up. Someone said Heller had been one of General Hood's boys, and was therefore suspect, because everyone knew Hood was as bent as a nine dollar bill. Reacher shook his head and spoke for the first time in an hour.</p> <p>"No," he said. "Heller worked for Hood, but he was never one of the boys. In fact the smart money said Heller was the guy who would take Hood down one day."</p> <p>"You know Heller?" someone asked.</p> <p>"No," Reacher said again. "But I met a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. And I heard things."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"I made a mental note, that's all. Heller's OK."</p> <p>"As good as us?"</p> <p>"Better."</p> <p>"Than you too?"</p> Reacher smiled. "He's in the rear view mirror. A little closer than some."<p></p> <p>"What's he like?"</p> <p>"He drives a Land Rover. A thing called a Defender. British. Like a Willys jeep without the frills. That's about all you need to know, right there."</p> <p>"So he's a caveman, like you."</p> <p>"No, that's where it gets complicated. He's very smart with technology. I heard he did a couple of years in D.C. with one of those hi-tech Beltway firms. Like the CIA, but private. Better paid. And more efficient, obviously."</p> <p>"I heard he's in Boston," someone said.</p> Reacher nodded. <p>"There was an issue."</p> <p>"What kind?"</p> <p>"Ethical, probably. Heller's got a backbone. Guys like that have problems in D.C."</p> <p>"His dad was a crook."</p> <p>"Financial," Reacher said. </p><p>"They're all crooks. But Heller's OK."</p> <p>"Would you trust him? You?"</p> <p>"Probably," Reacher said. "He's a stand-up guy. Apparently he went to bat for his brother a year or so ago. No reason to, but he did. It was a bad situation, too. But he came out ahead. Some very nice moves. There's a nephew, they say. Weird kid, but Heller does his best. And his mother is still on the scene. Someone once told me a guy who gets along with his mother can't be all bad."</p> <p>"Who told you that?"</p> <p>"My mother."</p> <p>"What's he doing in Boston? Private eye?"</p> <p>"Not exactly," Reacher said. "More like a private spy. He put together a crew up there. They do the CIA stuff in the office, and then he goes and does the black ops stuff himself. One stop shopping."</p> <p>"Is he a Red Sox fan?"</p> <p>"I hope not."</p> <p>"Still, Boston. Quiet up there."</p> <p>"Not very," Reacher said. "Guy I met was talking about a kidnapping. Some rich girl taken out of a night club. Billionaire father, and so on and so forth. Some serious Russians involved. I mean, serious as lung cancer. But it turned out OK."</p> <p>"That was Heller?"</p> <p>"Lips are sealed, but I don't see who else it could have been. It was done about ninety percent the same way I would have done it. Which means it had to be Heller. There's no one else that good up there."</p> <p>"You've got competition," someone said.</p> Reacher smiled again.<p></p> <p>"Human nature," he said. "There are always new guys. Law of averages says some of them will be good."</p> <p>"Would you call him? If you were in trouble in Boston?"</p> <p>"I don't have a phone," Reacher said. </p><p>"But I'd be happy enough if he happened to show up.

The first of these, Village School, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature. She lives in Berkshire.Miss Read's 34th Thrush Green idyll, illustrated as always by the gentle sketches of genteel chaps and aging lassies of John S. Goodall. What's new now in that English never-never land of secure, truly decent (albeit with a handful of manageable exceptions) country men and women, where no one lacks help or a haven in tribulation? Well, there's a new neighbor, the incoming schoolmaster and his mysteriously perennially ill wife. Mysterious, until it's general knowledge that she has a, uh, problem. Poor Violet Lovelock, youngest of the three antique Lovelock sisters, is in a highly nervous state since eldest sister Beatrice has been discovered popping scones at the Fuchsia Bush tea shop and has moved a considerable number of articles in her bedroom. And lonely farmer Percy (you remember he was disagreeable when schoolteacher Dorothy hit--not fatally--his dog with her new car) is quietly courting, and everyone thinks he's after young Doreen Lilly, who's home with mother and Doreen's fatherless tot. The vicar, the doctor, and all the good people rally round and things seem to be set right. Oh, yes, the retired schoolteachers, Dorothy and Agnes, visit now and then, and on one visit Agnes reveals the shocking news that Dorothy may have more than kindly inclinations toward elderly Teddy in their new village. Agnes fears the worst. More of the soothing same. Take a chapter or two before bedtime. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i></p><h2>Poems 1962-2012</h2><p><p>It is the astonishment of Louise Gl�ck's poetry that it resists collection. With each successive book her drive to leave behind what came before has grown more fierce, the force of her gaze fixed on what has yet to be imagined. She invented a form to accommodate this need, the book-length sequence of poems, like a landscape seen from above, a novel with lacunae opening onto the unspeakable. The reiterated yet endlessly transfigured elements in this landscape&#x2015;Persephone, a copper beech, a mother and father and sister, a garden, a husband and son, a horse, a dog, a field on fire, a mountain&#x2015;persistently emerge and reappear with the dark energy of the inevitable, shot through with the bright aspect of things new-made. <br> From the outset ("<i>Come here / Come here, little one</i>"), Gluck's voice has addressed us with deceptive simplicity, the poems in lines so clear we "do not see the intervening fathoms." </p><p><i>From within the earth's</i><br><i>bitter disgrace, coldness and barrenness</i><br><i></i><br><i>my friend the moon rises: </i><br><i>she is beautiful tonight, but when is she not beautiful?</i><br><i></i><br>To read these books together is to understand the governing paradox of a life lived in the body and of the work wrested from it, the one fated to die and the other to endure.</p></p><p><p><b>Louise Gl�ck</b> is the author of eleven books of poems and a collection of essays. Her many awards include the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, the Bollingen Prize for Poetry, and the Wallace Stevens Award from the Academy of American Poets. She teaches at Yale University and lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p><p>&#x201c;Ms. Gl�ck's new and career-spanning <i>Poems 1962-2012</i> is a major event in this country's literature, perhaps this year's most major . . . Put together, these compact volumes have a great novel's cohesiveness and raking moral intensity. They display a supple and prosecutorial mind interrogating not merely her own life but also the sensual and political nature of the world that spins around it. Her poems bring with them perilously low barometric pressure . . . Her father helped invent the X-acto knife. This is a cosmically sublime detail; no other poet slices with such accuracy and deadly intent . . . I look forward to whatever she writes next about aging, and I hope she goes on writing about it for a very long time indeed. Ms. Gl�ck is fearless. &#x2018;Why love what you will lose?' she asks. She answers her own question: &#x2018;There is nothing else to love.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dwight Garner, The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gl�ck's <i>Poems 1962-2012</i> is a big book by a poet who values, above all, intensity of address, leanness of sentiment, and precision of speech . . . [She is] among the most moving poets of our era . . . Gl�ck's innovation, in her best early poems, was to borrow the coolest American style and apply it to the hottest material: she was an objectivist of the emotions . . . This voice is not going to go away.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Dan Chiasson, The New Yorker</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gl�ck's latest volume . . . reminds us that she has been not only a resourceful and versatile poet but also an astonishingly brave one. Brave in what sense? In the way she has steadily enlarged her range and idiom, working, to be sure, within the compass of her own nature, but ever testing the limits of her gift, so that the impression made by the work as a whole is not of limitation but of an overwhelming fullness of invention and abundance of life. Gl�ck's poems at their best have always moved between recoil and affirmation, sensuous immediacy and reflection. She has found ways to engage with the world as it is without capitulating to its felt demand that she renounce any alternative sense of what is real. For a poet who can often seem earthbound and defiantly unillusioned, she has been powerfully responsive to the lure of the daily miracle and the sudden upsurge of overmastering emotion . . . Reality has existed for Gl�ck simultaneously as foundation and irritant. She acknowledges what seems to her indisputably true--like the fact of death, or the loss of love--while refusing to concede that the soul is merely what Wallace Stevens once called a &#x2018;rustic memorial of a belief' long consigned to irrelevance. Fierce in her determination to see things as they are, she fashions poems that suggest how much more there is to know than she can say. Incorrigibly committed to lucidity and alert against even the slightest imprecision, she ventures in and ventures out as if full comprehensibility were a chimera and an obstacle to true understanding . . . Reading Gl�ck, it is hard not to think that the poems come from what R.P. Blackmur once described as &#x2018;the whole history of the common language of the mind, or as Yeats calls it of the soul.' And yet--one more time and yet--Gl�ck's poems can also be thought of as expressions of a very particular and troubled person, a poet determined to get to the bottom of her own experience without making an idol of &#x2018;reality' or brute suffering. As with other great poets, Gl�ck does not invite paraphrase. Her poems at their best--and they are very often at their best--embody not just the rage to order, but also the rage to identify a &#x2018;truth' that no order can approximate or touch.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Robert Boyers, The Nation</i></p><p>&#x201c;Gl�ck is as important and influential a poet as we have in America . . . Gl�ck's work is all edges . . . the sharper ones can inflict heavenly hurt, where the meanings are. If you want to know about the last half-century of American poetry, you need to read these poems.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Michael Robbins, The Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Since 1962 few American poets have succeeded as well in writing as a poet of poise as Louise Gl�ck . . . Gl�ck has long favored subjects of disharmony as a means to achieve a poetry of poise . . . Gl�ck forces pain to take a bow in her poems. She requires tenderness to admit its shadow afflictions . . . Her poems convulse, twinge, and even gripe. Or, as she asks in an early poem: &#x2018;How much beauty can a person bear?' And yet even burdened with the weight of so much distress, her poems most certainly embody the beautiful. That is, distress as beauty. When you consider the ferocious, relentless, merciless, unforgiving, and self-diagnostic stance that has characterized her poems for 50 years as a means to render beauty, you come to see that she is unparalleled in finding beauty in tribulation more so than any American poet since Emily Dickinson . . . Friction and discordance are the means by which she finds insight--and that insight conveys poise in the face of unrequited desire. Which makes her a poet of yearning too--and so she often conveys yearning (even if one does not achieve the object of one's yearning) as a form of beauty as well. These negations have made her the finest poet of austere emotion that we have,--with her signature tone of solemnity a mark of beauty, too. To withstand negation is to unveil poise.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>David Biespiel, The Oregonian</i></p><p>&#x201c;Emerging from a reading of this accomplished collected works is like having run a rigorous marathon. While in shorter individual collections Louise Gl�ck's consistency of tone has the effect of unifying her poems, in a much larger assemblage like this one, the boundaries of individual poems seem to dissolve and merge into what has the feel of one long, extended poem that is an invigorating but demanding read. Gl�ck's voice is like no other in modern American poetry. Her poetic domain--like that of Wallace Stevens--lies in the seclusion of analytic thought. The seamless continuity of her verse suggests a mind in perpetual meditation, deliberating in a state of waking dream. Her laserlike intensity purifies as it objectifies and erodes, leaving an indelible impression on the reader.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Rita Signorelli-Pappas, World Literature Today</i></p><p>&#x201c;Eleven previous collections are gathered here, echoing with synergistic reverberations, as Gl�ck explores--with growing mastery and imagination, candor and wide-ranging inquiry, intensity and restraint&#x2013;&#x2013;the turmoil of family life; the fever, bliss, and misery of lust and love; the circular battle with the self; age and death. For 50 years, Gl�ck, a former U.S. poet laureate and Pulitzer winner, has been writing poems of formal elegance, psychic intimacy, brainy fusion, emotional acuity, and aesthetic splendor. As intimate and immediate as her lyrics are, Gl�ck is also vatic, summoning the old gods and the timeless myths to trace the human stream of consciousness, experience, and dream. Gl�ck's assembled life's work of shadow and fire, driven by &#x2018;perception of beauty, desire for knowledge,' is magnificent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Though Gl�ck has held national fame since the late 1970s for her terse, pared-down poems, this first career-spanning collected may be the most widely noted, and the most praised, collected poems in some time. Here is the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>The Wild Iris</i> (1992), whose talking flowers encapsulated birth, death, loss, and hope; here are the starkly framed family memories of her controversial <i>Ararat</i> (1990), and the careful, self-accusing humor of late work such as <i>The Seven Ages</i> (2001). Here, too, are the stormy, almost overexposed poems (reminiscent of Robert Lowell) with which she began, and the calmly uncompromising universals of <i>A Village Life</i> (2009), where &#x2018;the mountain stands like a beacon, to remind the night that the earth exists.' Through screens of familiar stories (Achilles, Penelope, Dante) or through overt--albeit terse--autobiography, Gl�ck at once scrutinizes her own life and reflects on the process by which poems get made, the way that we, too, may come to know ourselves: &#x2018;Like everyone else,' she reflects, &#x2018;I had a story,/ a point of view.// A few words were all I needed:/ nourish, sustain, attack.' Turning life stories to myths; myths to cool, scary proverbs, Gl�ck compares her style accurately to &#x2018;bright light through the bare tree,' her process of writing to spying, to silent listening: &#x2018;In my own mind, I'm invisible--that's why I'm dangerous.'&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (starred review)</i></p></p><h2>Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future</h2><p>From the preface to its closing pages &#34;Beyond Good and Evil&#34; is fired by a passion which expresses itself in an idiom of poetic metaphor. Yet this is philosophy. It covers almost the whole range of Nietzsche&#39;s philosophical interests, from the &#34;will to power&#34; to the psychology of religion, and belies its aphoristic structure with an idiosyncratic system of logical and linguistic links.</p><p>The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche was born in Prussia in 1844. After the death of his father, a Lutheran minister, Nietzsche was raised from the age of five by his mother in a household of women. In 1869 he was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Basel, where he taught until 1879 when poor health forced him to retire. He never recovered from a nervous breakdown in 1889 and died eleven years later. Known for saying that &#x201c;god is dead,&#x201d; Nietzsche propounded his metaphysical construct of the superiority of the disciplined individual (superman) living in the present over traditional values derived from Christianity and its emphasis on heavenly rewards. His ideas were appropriated by the Fascists, who turned his theories into social realities that he had never intended. <br> <b>R. J.

But the further he studied the Bible, the more he found himself confronted by questions that could neither be answered within the rigid framework of his religious instruction or accepted among the conservative evangelical community.</p><p>Rejecting the increasingly complicated intellectual games used by conservative Christians to &#x201c;protect&#x201d; the Bible, Enns was conflicted. <em>Is this what God really requires? How could God&#x2019;s plan for divine inspiration mean ignoring what is really written in the Bible?</em> These questions eventually cost Enns his job&#x2014;but they also opened a new spiritual path for him to follow.</p><p><em>The Bible Tells Me So</em> chronicles Enns&#x2019;s spiritual odyssey, how he came to see beyond restrictive doctrine and learned to embrace God&#x2019;s Word as it is actually written. As he explores questions progressive evangelical readers of Scripture commonly face yet fear voicing, Enns reveals that they are the very questions that God wants us to consider&#x2014;the essence of our spiritual study.</p></p><p><p>Christians have been defending scripture from attack for two centuries. In fact, argues Bible scholar Peter Enns, we have become so busy protecting the Bible that we are now unable to read it. In <em>The Bible Tells Me So</em>, he provides a revolutionary new perspective:</p><p>"What if <em>God</em> is actually fine with the Bible just as it is? Not the well-behaved version we create, but the messy, troubling, weird, and ancient Bible has something to show us about our own sacred journey of faith. Sweating bullets to line up the Bible with our exhausting expectations, to make the Bible something it's not meant to be, isn't a pious act of faith, even if it looks that way on the surface. It's actually a thinly masked fear of losing control and certainty, a mirror of our inner disquiet, a warning signal of a deep distrust in God. A Bible like that isn't a sure foundation of faith; it's a barrier to true faith. Creating a Bible that behaves itself doesn't support the spiritual journey; it cripples it. The Bible's raw messiness isn't a problem to be solved. It's an invitation to a deeper faith."</p><p>Christians have had it drilled into them that their job is to defend the Bible against any challenge. But is this really God's plan? What if God wants us to debate and wrestle with what we read in scripture? In <em>The Bible Tells Me So</em>, Enns wants to do for the Bible what Rob Bell did for hell in <em>Love Wins</em>: expose Christians' fear-based contradictory beliefs and show a new way forward. Here you will find a revolutionary guide that will liberate Christians so they can truly engage with God's Word.</p>Dr. Peter Enns (PhD, Harvard University) is Abram S. Clemens professor of Biblical Studies at Eastern University, St. Davids, PA.

Written with the compassion and understanding that could come only from John Gray, it takes readers through the five stages of dating: Attraction, Ambivalence, Commitment (to monogamy), True Intimacy and Proposal/Marriage. In its pages, readers will find creative ideas on finding a soulmate, making a commitment and sage advice on such difficult issues as deciding when to become sexually intimate and whether or not to live with their partner. <p> The singles universe can be a nebulous and frightening place, and the men and women alone in this void have great need for the wisdom of John Gray. In the same way that <em>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</em> became the ultimate relationship book for couples, <em>Mars and Venus on a Date</em> will be the singles' essential guide.</p></p><p>The latest tentacle of John Gray's formidable Mars and Venus octopus deals with a topic near to the heart of almost everybody--dating. With a lot of insight and common sense, Gray tackles the hard and often messy business of finding "a soul mate." Without fear or favor, <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> dissects the dynamics between men and women and the five stages each relationship must pass through: attraction, uncertainty, exclusivity, intimacy, and, finally, engagement (for marriage, of course). Even though <i>Mars and Venus on a Date</i> isn't <i>The Rules</i> by a long shot, the courtship it describes is surprisingly old-fashioned. It's chock-full of things your mother might say: "Most people find or are found by their soul mates when they are not really looking." "The man should never talk more than the woman." But how to know if the person you're with is your "soul mate?" Gray writes, "When our soul wants to marry our partner, it feels like a promise that we came into this world to keep." Which translates into, "When you know, you know."<p>John Gray, Ph.D., is one of the world&#x2019;s leading relationship experts, and an authority on improving communication styles for couples, companies, and communities. His many books have sold more than fifty million copies in fifty different languages worldwide. John lives with his wife and children in northern California.</p></p><h2>War! What Is It Good For?: Conflict and the Progress of Civilization from Primates to Robots</h2><p><p><b>A powerful and provocative exploration of how war has changed our society&#x2015;for the better</b><br><b></b></p><p>"War! . . . . / What is it good for? / Absolutely nothing," says the famous song&#x2015;but archaeology, history, and biology show that war in fact has been good for something. Surprising as it sounds, war has made humanity safer and richer.</p><p>In <i>War! What Is It Good For?</i>, the renowned historian and archaeologist Ian Morris tells the gruesome, gripping story of fifteen thousand years of war, going beyond the battles and brutality to reveal what war has really done to and for the world. Stone Age people lived in small, feuding societies and stood a one-in-ten or even one-in-five chance of dying violently. In the twentieth century, by contrast&#x2015;despite two world wars, Hiroshima, and the Holocaust&#x2015;fewer than one person in a hundred died violently. The explanation: War, and war alone, has created bigger, more complex societies, ruled by governments that have stamped out internal violence. Strangely enough, killing has made the world safer, and the safety it has produced has allowed people to make the world richer too.</p><p>War has been history's greatest paradox, but this searching study of fifteen thousand years of violence suggests that the next half century is going to be the most dangerous of all time. If we can survive it, the age-old dream of ending war may yet come to pass. But, Morris argues, only if we understand what war has been good for can we know where it will take us next.</p></p><p><b>Ian Morris</b> is the Jean and Rebecca Willard Professor of Classics and Professor in History at Stanford University and the author of the critically acclaimed <i>Why the West Rules&#x2015;for Now</i>.

WAR AND PEACE IN ANCIENT ROME <br>&nbsp; <br> <i>The Battle at the Edge of the World</i> <br>For the first time in memory, the tribes had made peace&#x2014;Vacomagi with Taexali, Decantae with Lugi, and Caereni with Carnonacae&#x2014;and every man who could hold a sword was streaming toward the Graupian Mountain. This, the chiefs agreed, was the way the Romans would come. And here, where the highlands dropped down toward the cold North Sea (Figure 1.1), the Caledonians would make a stand that would live in song forever. <br>We will never know what praise the long-haired Celtic bards heaped on the heroes who fought that day; all their epics are long forgotten. Only a single account of what happened now survives, written by Tacitus, one of the greatest of ancient Rome&#x2019;s historians. Tacitus did not follow the army to the Graupian Mountain, but he did marry the general&#x2019;s daughter, and when we put his description of the fighting together with archaeologists&#x2019; finds and other Roman writings, we get two things&#x2014;not only a pretty good idea of what happened when the armies clashed nearly two thousand years ago,* but also a stark statement of the problem that this book tries to solve. <br>&#x201c;Men of the North!&#x201d; <br>Calgacus was shouting at the top of his lungs, trying to be heard over the chanting of war bands, the braying of copper horns, and the clattering of chariots in the valley below. In front of him were thirty thousand jostling, disorderly men, more than anyone had ever seen in these northern wilds. He raised his arms for quiet but got none. <br>&#x201c;Men! Listen to me!&#x201d; For a moment, the din got even louder as men started chanting Calgacus&#x2019;s name, but then it dipped slightly, in respect for the great warrior, the fiercest of the dozens of Caledonian chieftains. <br>&#x201c;Men of the North! This is the dawn of freedom for Britain! We&#x2019;re going to fight, all of us in it together. It&#x2019;s a day for heroes&#x2014;and even if you&#x2019;re a coward, fighting&#x2019;s going to be the safest thing now!&#x201d; For a moment, the pale sun broke through the leaden northern sky, and cheering interrupted Calgacus again. He threw back his head and roared defiance. <br>&#x201c;Listen to me! We live at the end of the world. We&#x2019;re the last free men on earth. There&#x2019;s no one else behind us&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing there except rocks and waves, and even those are full of Romans. There&#x2019;s no escaping them. They&#x2019;ve robbed the world, and now that they&#x2019;ve stolen everything on land, they&#x2019;re even looting the sea. If they think you&#x2019;ve got money, they attack you out of greed; if they think you&#x2019;ve got nothing, they attack you out of arrogance. They&#x2019;ve robbed the whole of the East and the whole of the West, but they&#x2019;re still not satisfied. They&#x2019;re the only people on earth who want to rob rich and poor alike. They call stealing, killing, and rape by the lying name of government! They make a wasteland and call it peace!&#x201d; <br>A groundswell of hoarse shouting, stamping feet, and swords clashing on shields swallowed the rest of Calgacus&#x2019;s words. Without anyone giving orders, the war bands started moving forward. Some were in groups of a hundred or more behind a chief, while other men charged forward on their own, dancing with excitement. Calgacus pulled on a chain-mail shirt and ran after his men. The battle was on. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Half a mile away, the Romans were waiting. For six summers, their general Agricola had been looking for a fight, pushing farther and farther north, burning the Britons&#x2019; homes and crops to goad them into taking a stand. And now, in A.D. 83, as autumn closed in, he had finally got what he wanted: a battle. His men were outnumbered, far from their forts, and at the limits of their supply lines, but it was a battle all the same. He was delighted. <br>Agricola had drawn his men up in two lines, running straight as rulers without regard for the dips and folds of the land. Out in front were the auxiliaries, fighting for the money (which was good), the hope of plunder (which was better), and the promise of Roman citizenship after twenty-five years of service. On this campaign, most were Germans, hired along the banks of the Rhine. Some were on horseback, covering the wings, but most were on foot. These were no broadsword-swinging tribesmen: standing almost shoulder to shoulder, they carried javelins and short stabbing swords, sweating under thirty-pound loads of chain mail, iron helmets, and shields (Figure 1.2). <br>In the second line were the even more heavily armed elite citizen legionaries, the best soldiers in the world. Sending away his horse, Agricola took a place with the standard-bearers in front of them. <br>Just as Agricola had expected, the fight did not take long. The Caledonians surged into the valley, running as close to the Romans as they dared before throwing their spears and scrambling back to safety. Agricola&#x2019;s men were falling here and there, wounded in their unarmored thighs or sometimes killed outright, but the general waited. Only when he judged that enough of the enemy had crowded into the valley to make maneuver difficult did he order the auxiliaries forward. <br>Some of the Caledonians turned and ran right away. Others stood, trying to find room to swing their two-handed broadswords in huge arcs that smashed through armor, flesh, and bone, chopping men in two. But the auxiliaries steadily came on, rank upon rank in heavy metal armor, pushing in too near for the scattered highlanders to use their unwieldy weapons. Intimately close, Romans smashed iron-rimmed shields into noses and teeth, drove their short swords through ribs and throats, and trampled their victims in the wet grass. Eruptions of blood clotted thickly on their chain mail and visors, but they kept moving, leaving those in the rear to finish off the dazed and injured. <br>No plan survives contact with the enemy, the saying goes, and as the Roman auxiliaries pushed uphill, the orderly ranks that had so far made them unstoppable began breaking up. Exhausted, soaked now in sweat as much as blood, they slowed and then stopped. In twos and threes, Caledonian swordsmen turned and stood their ground among boulders and trees. For minutes that felt as long as hours, they shouted abuse at the Romans and threw stones and any remaining spears; then, as their line grew firmer, the bravest edged closer to the invaders. More and more fighters came running back down the slopes, emboldened, and spilled around the Romans&#x2019; flanks. The auxiliaries&#x2019; advance ground to a halt. As they felt the tide turning, Caledonian cavalry on mud-spattered ponies came pushing behind the Germans, spearing them in their legs and hemming them in so tightly that they could not fight back. <br>Across the valley, Agricola still had not moved, but now he gave a signal, and a trumpet blew a new command. His auxiliary cavalry jingled and clattered forward. Neatly, as if on a parade ground, their deep column unfolded into a wide line. The trumpet blew again, and the men lowered their spears. A third time it blew, and the riders kicked their horses into a gallop. Gripping the horses&#x2019; bellies with their knees (this was five centuries before the coming of stirrups), they leaned into the wind, blood pounding and the thunder of hooves filling their world as they shrieked out their rage. <br>Here and there knots of Caledonians turned to fight as Roman riders fell on them from behind. There was frantic stabbing, spear against spear, as the Romans rushed past. In a few places, horses crashed straight into each other, spilling riders and steeds to the ground in screaming tumbles of broken legs and backs. But for the most part, the northerners fled, unreasoning panic blacking out every thought but escape. And as the men around them melted away, the fury drained out of those few who had kept their ground. Throwing down their weapons, they ran too. <br>An army becomes a mob in moments. There were still enough Caledonians to smother the Romans, but with all order gone, hope departed too. Through gorse and stream, across the slopes of the Graupian Mountain, Roman riders speared everything that moved and trampled anything that did not. When trees provided cover, Caledonians would cluster in their shadow, hoping to wait out the Roman storm, but the Roman riders, methodical in the midst of chaos, dismounted, flushed the enemy back into the open, and then resumed the chase. <br>The Romans kept killing till night fell. By their best guess, they butchered about 10,000 Caledonians. Calgacus was probably among them, since his name never crops up in our sources again. Agricola, by contrast, had not a scratch on him. Just 360 Roman auxiliaries had died, and not even one legionary. <br>In the darkness, the historian Tacitus tells us, &#x201c;the Britons scattered, men and women wailing together, carrying off their wounded or calling to survivors. Some fled their homes, and in a frenzy, even set fire to them. Others chose hiding places, only to abandon them straightaway. At one moment they started forming plans, only to stop and break up their conference. Sometimes the sight of their loved ones broke their hearts; more often it goaded them to fury. We found clear signs that some of them had even laid hands on their wives and children in pity&#x2014;of a kind.&#x201d; <br>By the time the sun came up, Tacitus continues, &#x201c;an awful silence had settled everywhere. The hills were deserted, houses were smoking in the distance, and our scouts met no one.&#x201d; Calgacus had been right: Rome had made a wasteland and called it peace. <br> <i>Pax Romana</i> <br>Winter was coming. With his enemies broken and his army stretched thin, Agricola left the Caledonians to their suffering and led his troops back toward their bases. <br>The farther south they marched, deeper into territory Rome had held for decades, the less it looked like a wasteland. There were no burned-out ruins, no starving refugees; rather, the Romans saw well-tended fields, bustling towns, and merchants eager to sell to them. Prosperous farmers were drinking Italian wine from fine imported cups, and Britain&#x2019;s formerly wild warlords had exchanged their hillforts for luxurious villas. They sported togas over their tattoos and sent their sons to learn Latin. <br>Here was a paradox that might have troubled Calgacus, had he been alive to see it. To most people on the Roman side of the frontier, though, the explanation for why the Roman Empire was <i>not</i> a wasteland was obvious. The orator Marcus Tullius Cicero put it best a century and a half earlier, in a letter to his brother Quintus, who was then governing the wealthy Greek province of Asia (roughly the western quarter of modern Turkey). This was an excellent posting, but Quintus had temper problems, and the provincials under him had been complaining. <br>After a few pages of stern elder-sibling advice, Marcus&#x2019;s tone changed. The fault, he concluded, was not all on Quintus&#x2019;s side. The Greeks needed to face facts. &#x201c;Let Asia think on this,&#x201d; he pointed out. &#x201c;Were she not under our government, there&#x2019;s no calamity of foreign war and civil strife that she&#x2019;d escape. And since there&#x2019;s no way to provide government without taxes, Asia should be happy to purchase perpetual peace at the price of a few of her products.&#x201d; <br>Calgacus or Cicero; wasteland or wonderland? These two competing views of the consequences of war, formulated so sharply two thousand years ago, will dominate this book. <br>In an ideal world, we could settle the debate by just running the numbers. If violent deaths fell and prosperity rose after the Roman conquests, we could conclude that Cicero was right; war was good for something. If the results came out the other way, then obviously Calgacus understood his age better, and war made only wastelands. We could then rerun the test on later periods of history in Chapters 2&#x2013;5, coming to an overall conclusion about what&#x2014;if anything&#x2014;war has been good for. <br>But reality is rarely that convenient. I mentioned in the introduction that building databases of deaths in battle has grown into a minor academic industry, but few reliable statistics go back past A.D. 1500, even in Europe. Only one kind of evidence&#x2014;the physical remains of our bodies, which often carry telltale traces of lethal violence&#x2014;has the potential to span every period, going back to the origins of humanity itself. One day we can expect to have reliable statistics from this source, but right now the problem is that not many scholars have made large-scale studies of this complicated, technically challenging material, and even when they have, the picture remains rather unclear. <br>One study (published in 2012) of skulls in collections at Tel Aviv University, for instance, found precious few differences in levels of violence across the last six thousand years. A 2013 analysis of skeletons from Peru, however, found spikes in violence in periods when bigger states were being formed (roughly 400 B.C.&#x2013;A.D. 100 and A.D. 1000&#x2013;1400)&#x2014;which is roughly consistent with this book&#x2019;s arguments. Until we have far more of this evidence, all we will be able to do for periods before A.D. 1500 (and in some parts of the world, even into our own century) is bundle together all kinds of evidence, including archaeology, literary anecdotes, and anthropological comparisons, with&#x2014;once in a while&#x2014;some actual numbers. <br>This is a messy business, made even messier by the sheer scale of the Roman Empire. By Calgacus&#x2019;s day it sprawled across an area half the size of the continental United States and contained about sixty million people. Roughly forty million (Greeks, Syrians, Jews, Egyptians) lived in the complex, urban societies of its eastern half, with another twenty million (Celts and Germans) in the simpler rural and tribal societies of the west. <br>We have already heard Cicero&#x2019;s views on the violence of Greek Asia before the Roman conquest, and other writers made the barbarians (as Romans dismissively called them)* of the west sound even worse. Fights, raids, and battles were everyday activities, the Romans said, and every village was fortified. While a Roman gentleman might feel underdressed without his toga, a German felt naked without his shield and spear. The barbarians, Romans insisted, worshipped severed heads, which they liked to hang outside their front doors (suitably treated with cedar oil to stop them from smelling). They sacrificed humans to their angry gods, and sometimes even burned them alive inside wickerwork statues. Tacitus was blunt: &#x201c;Germans have no taste for peace.&#x201d; <br>Small wonder, then, that Cicero and his peers thought Rome was doing its neighbors a favor by conquering them. And it is equally unsurprising, some historians suggest, that when modern classical scholarship took shape in the eighteenth century, most of its towering intellects agreed with the Romans. Europeans liked to think that they too were doing the world a favor by conquering it, and so the Romans&#x2019; arguments struck them as eminently reasonable. <br>On the heels of Europe&#x2019;s retreat from empire in the later twentieth century, however, classicists began wondering about the Romans&#x2019; gory picture of the people they conquered. Ancient imperialists, some scholars suggested, might have been just as eager as the modern version to paint their victims as uncivilized, corrupt, and in general need of conquest. Cicero wanted to justify exploiting Greeks; Caesar, to make attacking Gaul (roughly modern France) look necessary; and Tacitus, to glorify his father-in-law, Agricola. <br>Taking Caesar&#x2019;s word that the Gauls needed conquering might be as unwise as simply swallowing whole Rudyard Kipling&#x2019;s now-notorious claim (which I will come back to in Chapter 4) that governing new-caught, sullen peoples was the white man&#x2019;s burden. Fortunately, though, we do not have to take the Romans&#x2019; word for anything, because plenty of other vo...</p><h2>Patsy&#39;s Cookbook: Classic Italian Recipes from a New York City Landmark Restaurant</h2><p><b>From the Restaurant That Frank Sinatra Made Famous</b><br><br>Of the thousands of restaurants in New York City, very few withstand the tests of time&#x2014;and only one can lay claim to being Frank Sinatra&#x2019;s favorite.

On the surface, these stories tell us very little about Sarah, and what they do tell is complicated and confused by the probability that it represents residue surviving from two different written sources based on two independent oral traditions. Nevertheless, the role which Sarah plays, in the Genesis narratives, apears to be a highly energetic one, a role so active, in fact, that it repeatedly overshadows that of her husband.<br><br>In a patriarchal environment such as the Canaan of Genesis, the situation is discordant and problematic. Dr. Teubal suggests that the difficulty is eliminated, however, if we understand that Sarah and the other matriarchs mentioned in the narratives acted within the established, traditional Mesopotamian role of priestess, of a class of women who retained a highly privileged position vis-a-vis their husbands.<br><br>Dr. Teubal shows that the &#x201c;Sarah tradition&#x201d; represents a nonpatriarchal system struggling for survival in isolation, in the patriarchal environment of what was for Sarah a foreign society. She further indicates that the insistence of Sarah and Rebekah that their sons and heirs marry wives from the old homeland had to do not so much with preference for endogamy and cousin marriage as with their intention of ensuring the continuation of their old <i>kahina</i>-tradition against the overwhelming odds represented by patriarchal Canaan.</p><p>&#39;Sarah the Priestess is a challenging and important work. It pushes us to read our sacred text with a new openness to questions never before asked, questions about women as sources of religious authority and tradition. It is a groundbreaking work of feminist biblical historiography.&#39; --Rabbi Laura Geller<b>Savina J.

Begun as a poem, Pilgrim's Regress thankfully ended up as an allegory that obviously takes its cue from John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress. Every bit as effective as its predecessor, Lewis's book describes the quest of John to reach the enchanted island and describes and satirizes many of the popular philosophies of the author's time, many of which also have more than a little influence in our day. Eloquent, erudite, and often witty, this tale is superbly narrated by Robert Whitfield. No stranger to the writings of Lewis, Whitfield has a well-modulated voice that easily portrays the numerous characters and gives the narrative sections a steady and consistent tempo.

Monet intended the water lilies to provide "an asylum of peaceful meditation." Yet, as Ross King reveals in his magisterial chronicle of both artist and masterpiece, these beautiful canvases belie the intense frustration Monet experienced in trying to capture the fugitive effects of light, water, and color. They also reflect the terrible personal torments Monet suffered in the last dozen years of his life. </p><p> <i>Mad Enchantment</i> tells the full story behind the creation of the <i>Water Lilies</i>, as the horrors of World War I came ever closer to Paris and Giverny and a new generation of younger artists, led by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, were challenging the achievements of Impressionism. By early 1914, French newspapers were reporting that Monet, by then seventy-three, had retired his brushes. He had lost his beloved wife, Alice, and his eldest son, Jean. His famously acute vision--what Paul Cezanne called &#x201c;the most prodigious eye in the history of painting&#x201d;--was threatened by cataracts. And yet, despite ill health, self-doubt, and advancing age, Monet began painting again on a more ambitious scale than ever before. Linking great artistic achievement to the personal and historical dramas unfolding around it, Ross King presents the most intimate and revealing portrait of an iconic figure in world culture.</p></p><p><b>Ross King</b> is the author of <i>Brunelleschi's Dome</i>,<i> Michelangelo and the Pope's Ceiling</i>, <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>,<i> Leonardo and The Last Supper</i>,<i> </i>and others.<i> </i>His work has been nominated for a National Book Critics Circle Award, the Charles Taylor Prize, and the National Award for Arts Writing. He has lectured at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian, the Aspen Institute, and the Frick Collection, and in Florence, Milan, Paris, and Giverny. He lives near Oxford with his wife, Melanie.Much of Claude Monet&#x2019;s life and work had been a mad striving for the impossible. His goal, which he frankly admitted was unattainable, was to paint his carefully chosen object&#x2014;the cathedral, cliff, or wheat stack before which he raised his easel&#x2014;under singular and fleeting conditions of weather and light. As he told an English visitor, he wanted &#x201c;to render my impressions before the most fugitive effects.&#x201d; In 1889 a critic had scoffed that Monet&#x2019;s paintings were nothing more than a matter of &#x201c;geography and the calendar.&#x201d; This was, however, to miss the point of Monet&#x2019;s work. Since objects changed their color and appearance according to the seasons, the meteorological conditions, and the time of day, Monet hoped to capture their visual impact in these brief, distinctive, ever-changing moments in time. He concentrated not&nbsp;only on the objects themselves but also, critically, on the atmosphere that surrounded them, the erratically shifting phantoms of light and color that he called the&nbsp;<i>enveloppe</i>. &#x201c;Everything changes, even stone,&#x201d; he wrote to Alice while working on his paintings of the fa�ade of Rouen&nbsp;Cathedral. But freezing the appearance of objects amid fleeting phantoms of light and air was no easy task. &#x201c;I am chasing a dream,&#x201d; he admitted in 1895. &#x201c;I want the impossible.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recording the fugitive effects of color and light was integral to Monet&#x2019;s art. Setting up his easel in front of Rouen Cathedral, or the wheat stacks in the frozen meadow outside Giverny, or the windswept cliffs at �tretat on the coast of Normandy, he would paint throughout the day as the light and weather, and finally the seasons, changed. To reproduce the desired effects accurately according to his personal sensations, he was forced to work outdoors, often in disagreeable conditions. In 1889 a journalist described him on the stormy beach beneath the cliffs at �tretat, &#x201c;dripping wet under his cloak, painting a hurricane in the salty spray&#x201d; as he tried to capture the different lighting conditions on two or three canvases that he shuttled back and forth onto his easel. Because lighting effects changed quickly&#x2014;every seven minutes, he once claimed&#x2014;he was forced, in his series paintings of wheat stacks and poplars, to work on multiple canvases almost simultaneously, placing a different one on his easel every seven minutes or so, rotating&nbsp;them according to the particular visual effect he was trying to capture. Clemenceau once watched him working in a poppy field with four different canvases. &#x201c;He was going from one to the other, according to the position of the sun.&#x201d; In the 1880s the writer Guy de Maupassant had likewise witnessed Monet &#x201c;in pursuit of impressions&#x201d; on the Normandy coast. He described how the painter was followed through the fields by his children and stepchildren &#x201c;carrying his canvases, five or six paintings depicting the same subject at different times and with different effects.&nbsp;He worked on them one by one, following all the changes in the sky.&#x201d; This obsession with capturing successive changes in the fall of light or the density of a fogbank could lead to episodes that were both comical (for observers) and infuriating (for Monet). In 1901, in London,&nbsp;he began painting what he called the &#x201c;unique atmosphere&#x201d; of the river Thames&#x2014;the famous pea-souper fogs&#x2014;from his room in the Savoy Hotel. Here he was visited by the painter John Singer Sargent, who found him surrounded by no fewer than ninety canvases, &#x201c;each one the record of a momentary effect of light over the Thames. When the effect was repeated and an opportunity occurred for finishing the picture,&#x201d; Sargent reported, &#x201c;the effect had generally passed away before the particular canvas could be found.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One irony of Monet&#x2019;s approach was that these paintings of fleeting visual effects at single moments in time actually took many months of work. &#x201c;I paint entirely out of doors,&#x201d; he once airily informed a journalist. &#x201c;I never touch my work in my studio.&#x201d; However, virtually all of Monet&#x2019;s canvases, although begun on the beaches or in the fields, were actually completed back in the studio, often far from the motif and with much teeth-gnashing labor. Octave Mirbeau reported that a single Monet canvas might take &#x201c;sixty sessions&#x201d; of work. Some of the canvases, moreover, were given fifteen layers of paint. His London paintings were finished not beside the banks of the Thames but as much as two years later in his studio in Giverny, beside the Seine, with the assistance of photographs. The revelation that Monet used photographs caused something of a scandal when this expedient was revealed in 1905 thanks to the indiscreet and possibly malicious comments of several of Monet&#x2019;s London acquaintances, including Sargent. Monet had risked a similar kind of scandal when he took one of his Rouen Cathedral paintings to Norway.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;There was another irony to Monet&#x2019;s paintings. Many of them evoked gorgeous visions of rural tranquility: sun-dappled summer afternoons along a riverbank or fashionable women promenading in flowery meadows. As Mirbeau wrote, nature appeared in Monet&#x2019;s paintings in &#x201c;warm breaths of love&#x201d; and &#x201c;spasms of joy.&#x201d; His pleasingly bucolic scenes were combined with a flickering brushwork that produced delicious vibrations of color. The overall result was that many observers regarded his paintings as possessing a soothing effect on both the eye and the brain&#x2014;and Monet himself as&nbsp;<i>le peintre du bonheur&nbsp;</i>(the painter of happiness). Geffroy believed Monet&#x2019;s works could offer comforting distraction and alleviate fatigue, while Monet himself speculated that they might calm &#x201c;nerves strained through overwork&#x201d; and offer the stressed out viewer &#x201c;an asylum of peaceful meditation.&#x201d; The writer Marcel Proust, an ardent admirer, even believed Monet&#x2019;s paintings could play a spiritually curative role &#x201c;analogous to that of psychotherapists with certain neurasthenics&#x201d;&#x2014;by which he meant those whose weakened nerves&nbsp;had left them at the mercy of fast-paced modern life. Proust was not alone. More than a century later, an Impressionist expert at Sotheby&#x2019;s in London called Monet &#x201c;the great anti-depressant.&#x201d;&nbsp;This &#x201c;great anti-depressant&#x201d; was, however, a neurasthenic who enjoyed anything but peaceful meditation as he worked on his paintings. Geffroy described Monet as &#x201c;a perpetual worrier, forever anguished,&#x201d; while to Clemenceau he was&nbsp;<i>le monstre&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>le roi des grincheux</i>&#x2014;&#x201c;king of the grumps.&#x201d; Monet could be volatile and bad-tempered at the best of times, but when work at his easel did not proceed to his satisfaction&#x2014;lamentably often&#x2014;he flew into long and terrible rages. Clemenceau neatly summed up the quintessential Monet scenario of the artist throwing a tantrum in the midst of blissful scenery: &#x201c;I imagine you in a Niagara of rainbows,&#x201d; he wrote to Monet, &#x201c;picking a fight with the sun.&#x201d; Monet&#x2019;s letters are filled with references to his gloom and anger. Part of his problem was the weather. Monet could pick a fight with the sun, the wind, or the rain. Painting in the open air left him at the mercy of the elements, at which he raged like King Lear. His constant gripes about the wind and rain had once earned him a scolding from Mirbeau: &#x201c;As for the nauseatingly horrible weather we have and that we will have until the end of August, you have the right to curse. But to believe that you&#x2019;re finished as a painter because it&#x2019;s raining and windy&#x2014;this is pure madness.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;It was a strange contradiction of Monet&#x2019;s practice that he wished to work in warm, calm, sunny conditions, and yet for much of his career he chose to paint in Normandy: a part of France that was, as a nineteenth-century guidebook glumly affirmed, &#x201c;generally cold and wet...subject to rapid and frequent changes, and fairly long spells of bad weather that result in unseasonable temperatures.&#x201d; Working on the windswept coast of Normandy in the spring of 1896, he found conditions exasperating. &#x201c;Yesterday I thought I would go mad,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;The wind blew away my canvases and, when I set down my palette to recover them, the wind blew it away too. I was so furious I almost threw everything away.&#x201d; Sometimes Monet did in fact throw everything away. On one occasion he hurled his color box into the river Epte in a blind rage, then was obliged to telegraph Paris, once he calmed down, to have a new one delivered. On another occasion, he flung himself into the Seine. &#x201c;Luckily no harm was done,&#x201d; he reassured a friend.&nbsp;Monet&#x2019;s canvases likewise felt his wrath. Jean-Pierre Hosched� witnessed him committing &#x201c;acts of violence&#x201d; against them, slashing them with a penknife, stamping them into the ground or thrusting his foot through them. An American visitor saw a painting of one of his stepdaughters with &#x201c;a tremendous crisscross rent right through the centre&#x201d;&#x2014;the result of an enraged Monet giving it a vicious kick. Since he had been wearing wooden clogs at the time, the damage was considerable. Sometimes he even set fire to his canvases before he could be stopped. On occasion his rages became so intense that he would roam the fields and then, to spare his family, check into a hotel nearby in Vernon. At other times he retreated to his bedroom for days at a time, refusing both meals and attempts at consolation. Friends tried to coax him from his gloom with diverting trips to Paris. &#x201c;Come to Paris for two days,&#x201d; Mirbeau pleaded with him during one of these spells. &#x201c;We shall walk. We shall go here and there...to the Jardin des Plantes, which is an&nbsp;admirable thing, and to the Th��tre-Fran�ais. We shall eat well, we shall say stupid things, and we shall not see any paintings.&#x201d; There was another contradiction in Monet&#x2019;s practice. He loved to paint and, indeed, he lived to paint&#x2014;and yet he claimed to find painting an unremitting torment. &#x201c;This satanic painting tortures me,&#x201d; he once wrote to a friend, the painter Berthe Morisot. To a journalist he said: &#x201c;Many people think I paint easily, but it is not an easy thing to be an artist. I often suffer tortures when I paint. It is a great joy and a great suffering.&#x201d; Monet&#x2019;s rage and suffering before his easel reveal the disingenuousness of his famous comment about Vincent van Gogh. Mirbeau, who owned Van Gogh&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Irises</i>, once proudly showed the work to Monet. &#x201c;How did a man who loved flowers and light so much,&#x201d; Monet responded, &#x201c;and who painted them so well, make himself so unhappy?&#x201d; Some of Monet&#x2019;s friends regarded his torture and suffering as a necessary condition of his genius&#x2014;as a symptom of his search for perfection, or what Geffroy called the &#x201c;dream of form and color&#x201d; that he pursued &#x201c;almost to the point of self-annihilation.&#x201d; After witnessing yet another fit of dyspepsia, Clemenceau wrote to Monet that &#x201c;if you were not pushed by an eternal search for the unattainable, you would not be the author of so many masterpieces.&#x201d; As Clemenceau once explained to his secretary apropos of Monet&#x2019;s dreadful fits of temper: &#x201c;One must suffer. One must not be satisfied...With a painter who slashes his canvases, who weeps, who explodes with rage in front of his painting, there&nbsp;is hope.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Clemenceau must have realized that in persuading Monet to paint large-scale canvases of his water lily pond he had not only rekindled the painter&#x2019;s hopes but also, as a sore temptation to fate, his exasperation and rage.</p><h2>Girl Who Loved Wild Horses, The</h2><p>Paintings inspired by the pictorial forms of the Plains Indians illustrate an original tale about a young girl who longs for the freedom of living among a herd of wild horses</p><p>For most people, being swept away in a horse stampede during a raging thunderstorm would be a terrifying disaster. For the young Native American girl in Paul Goble's 1979 Caldecott-winning masterpiece, <i>The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses</i>, it is a blessing. Although she loves her people, this girl has a much deeper, almost sacred connection to her equine friends. The storm gives her the opportunity to fulfill her dream--to live in a beautiful land among the wild horses she loves.<p> With brilliant, stylized illustrations and simple text, Paul Goble tells the story of a young woman who follows her heart, and the family that respects and accepts her uniqueness. Considering how difficult it is for some communities to allow friendships to grow between people of different cultures, this village's support for the girl's companions of choice is admirable. Goble's bold paintings reflect this noble open-mindedness. The young horse fanatic of the house will joyfully add this book to his or her collection. Children are passionate people; they will relate. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>In Paul Goble's Caldecott-winning story, tending to the horses is the special pleasure of one young girl in the village. Her skills are unsurpassed, and people take notice. When a violent thunderstorm crazes the herd, both it and the girl travel to new destinations. As narrator, Lance White Magpie sets an expectant tone, as it appears that the horses will change the girl's life. Finally, his voice becomes one of confidence and satisfaction when the young girl finds her place beside the spotted stallion. Gentle music surrounds the story. Chants and songs from Sioux and Navaho traditions complete the recording.

Do-gooder Eleanor was committed to social justice but hated the limelight; acid-tongued Alice, who became the wife of philandering Republican congressman Nicholas Longworth, was an opponent of big government who gained notoriety for her cutting remarks (she famously quipped that dour President Coolidge &#x201c;looked like he was weaned on a pickle&#x201d;). While Eleanor revolutionized the role of First Lady with her outspoken passion for human rights, Alice made the most of her insider connections to influence politics, including doing as much to defeat the League of Nations as anyone in elective office.<br><br>The cousins themselves liked to play up their oil-and-water relationship. &#x201c;When I think of Frank and Eleanor in the White House I could grind my teeth to powder and blow them out my nose,&#x201d; Alice once said. In the 1930s they even wrote opposing syndicated newspaper columns and embarked on competing nationwide speaking tours. Blood may be thicker than water, but when the family business is politics, winning trumps everything.<br><br>Vivid, intimate, and stylishly written, <i>Hissing Cousins</i> finally sets this relationship center stage, revealing the contentious bond between two political trailblazers who short-circuited the rules of gender and power, each in her own way.</p><p>Marc Peyser is a writer whose work has appeared in <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Life</i>, <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Time</i>, the <i>Huffington Post</i>, <i>Cond� Nast Traveler</i>, and the <i>Best Business Writing 2003</i>.

What she really wanted was to scotch the whole affair and just have someone announce her death after she&#x2019;d already been buried. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to be remembered happily if that is possible,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;If that can&#x2019;t be I&#x2019;d rather be forgotten.&#x201d; Forgotten? &#x201c;I had to tell her,&#x201d; said her friend William Turner Levy, &#x201c;that she was being unrealistic.&#x201d;<br><br>Unrealistic, but not surprising. After all, this was the famously unfussy First Lady who served hot dogs to the king and queen of England during their 1939 state visit, who dragged her own suitcase around the world on countless humanitarian missions, and who insisted, after her husband died, that she&#x2019;d never do anything newsworthy again. Naturally, she wanted her afterlife to be just as unpretentious as what came before. &#x201c;Just a plain pine coffin covered with pine boughs. Inside the coffin are to be plain pillows and sheet with cloth,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d written in a letter to her doctor years earlier.<br><br>The service was held in Hyde Park&#x2019;s St. James&#x2019; Church, which seated just 250 people. Among those who didn&#x2019;t make the guest list: Horace W. B. Donegan, the grandstanding Episcopal bishop of New York. The five Roo�se�velt children refused to invite him, dreading he would eulogize their mother at length. (He showed up anyway but otherwise kept quiet.) Even the weather seemed to cooperate with Eleanor&#x2019;s wishes. November 10, 1962, was a cold, damp day with the wind blowing off the Hudson River and pushing the chill through the streets of the town.<br><br>Yet the mourners, like the good bishop, weren&#x2019;t going to let a cold shoulder stop them from saying good-�bye. Thousands lined the roads, some standing five-�deep to watch the hearse carry Mrs. Roo�se�velt from St. James&#x2019; to the Roo�se�velt mansion, Springwood, two miles away. For generations, the Roo�se�velts of Hyde Park had been buried in the quiet graveyard behind the little church, but President Roo�se�velt had requested that he and Eleanor be laid to rest in the large rose garden just to the side of the family home. It was, in its way, the perfect spot. After all, &#x201c;Roo�se�velt&#x201d; in Dutch means &#x201c;field of roses.&#x201d; Perhaps just as important, FDR&#x2019;s overbearing mother, Sara, was tucked a safe distance away, resting in uncharacteristic silence back behind the church.<br><br>The president&#x2019;s arrangement, however, helped produce exactly the kind of funeral Eleanor wanted to avoid. It was as if someone had picked up the entire Macy&#x2019;s Thanksgiving Day Parade and dropped it into small-�town America. The nightly news, including the BBC, delivered extensive coverage. Limousine-�lock tied up the roads; amid all the excitement, two local keystone cops crashed their cruisers into each other right in front of the Hyde Park state police barracks. Most people were fans, but there were haters, too. One man standing along the funeral route waved a sign that read, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re dead, Eleanor.&#x201d; Two other men were arrested for carrying &#x201c;derogatory&#x201d; signs.<br><br>The roster of invited guests might have been small, but it was A-�plus-�list. President and Mrs. Kennedy arrived on Air Force One (which was taking its maiden voyage and would be used, almost exactly one year later, to transport JFK&#x2019;s body back from Dallas). Vice President and Mrs. Johnson came, as did the former presidents Truman and Eisenhower, making this the first time that three presidents attended the funeral of a First Lady. Chief Justice Warren, Secretary of State Rusk, Secretary of Defense McNamara, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, Governor Rockefeller of New York, the United Nations ambassador Stevenson, and a sizable contingent of the Washington establishment were there. One well-�aimed Soviet missile would have decimated the U.S. government.<br><br>That was no idle concern. Mrs. Roo�se�velt&#x2019;s funeral came at the tail end of the Cuban missile crisis. Just days earlier, Nikita Khrushchev had agreed to dismantle the Soviet missiles he&#x2019;d lined up in Cuba like cigars ready to be lit, and Castro was still threatening to shoot down anything bigger than a kite that wandered into his airspace. The U.S. military was so concerned, the Pentagon wanted to install a kind of hotline in the pew at St. James&#x2019; where President Kennedy was to be seated. The Reverend Gordon Kidd said no. &#x201c;If he had to talk on the phone during the service it would be terribly frustrating and confusing,&#x201d; Kidd reasoned. The Feds settled for a phone placed unobtrusively on an outside wall of the church, though Eleanor would undoubtedly have scoffed at that, too. After all, Khrushchev didn&#x2019;t scare her. She had visited him on his home turf in 1957 for a magazine interview, a somewhat tense meeting that ended with Khrushchev&#x2019;s declaring his own sort of d�tente with one of the world&#x2019;s most formidable women. &#x201c;At least,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;we didn&#x2019;t shoot each other.&#x201d; When he popped in for a visit at her woodsy Val-�Kill cottage two years later, Eleanor had only one real worry. She realized she had no vodka&#x2014;�even though Khrushchev was coming at 7:00 a.m. (Her son John dutifully ran down a bottle.)<br><br>Given all the world leaders Eleanor met and hosted over the years, it&#x2019;s hardly surprising that she received what was arguably the first power funeral of an American woman. What was notable was that one of Washington&#x2019;s most influential women was among the few who declined to attend. Her name was Alice Longworth. Mrs. L., as she was known, was a battle-�ready Republican, a Capitol Hill institution with a biting wit, and a woman who, like Eleanor, tossed aside gender barriers as easily as she flicked the ashes off her long-�stemmed cigarette holder. She was also Eleanor&#x2019;s first cousin.<br><br>Alice&#x2019;s father, Theodore Roo�se�velt, was the older brother of Eleanor&#x2019;s father, Elliott. To her cousin Eleanor, Alice was a childhood playmate, a teenage confidante, and, in adulthood, a relentless rival. Their relationship had taken a sharp turn for the worse thirty years earlier, when Franklin Roo�se�velt was elected president, a job Alice believed rightly belonged to her favorite brother, Theodore Roo�se�velt Jr.<br><br>Over the years, the press played Alice and Eleanor off each other like rivals in a blue-�blooded version of Oz: the good witch and the bad witch. Eleanor was the saint, the woman who revolutionized the role of First Lady with her very public activism, obvious concern for the poor and oppressed, and outspoken passion for human rights. She did more to cement the role of the United Nations in American and world diplomacy than any other woman and almost any man. Alice played the troublemaker. She relished any opportunity to tweak the stodgy establishment, and no one was more establishment&#x2014;�or, in Alice&#x2019;s eyes, more sanctimonious&#x2014;�than Anna Eleanor Roo�se�velt Roo�se�velt. Eleanor didn&#x2019;t just marry into the esteemed Roo�se�velt clan when she wed her fifth cousin Franklin. Roo�se�velt was also her maiden name.<br><br>Yet Alice was, in her own way, as much a pillar of power as Eleanor. As Theodore Roo�se�velt&#x2019;s beautiful and flamboyant daughter, she became arguably the century&#x2019;s first global celebrity when her father entered the White House in 1901. &#x201c;Princess Alice,&#x201d; as she was known on the front page, made headlines for her clothes, her smoking, her parties, even her pets. Her straitlaced parents despised all that frivolous attention&#x2014;�except when they wanted to leverage her popularity for their political advantage. In 1905, when the president needed someone who could charm the Japanese as he tried to negotiate the end of the Russo-�Japanese War, he sent twenty-�one-�year-�old Alice as part of the delegation. When the trip was over and the treaty was signed, Theodore Roo�se�velt was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Alice had to settle for marrying one of the men who traveled to Asia with her, though Nick Longworth was an Ohio congressman and future Speaker of the House.<br><br>As administrations came and went, Alice&#x2019;s backroom influence ebbed and flowed, but like the Potomac she always cut a swath through Washington. She appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1927, joined official American delegations overseas into the 1950s, and was still sitting in the front row at presidential races into the 1970s. Along the way, Mrs. L. acquired another nickname: Washington&#x2019;s Other Monument. She remained a force until she died, in 1980, at ninety-�six. Such a force that every president from Truman to Ford made sure to pay homage at Longworth&#x2019;s Massachusetts Avenue home on February 12&#x2014;�her birthday. Nixon, one of Alice&#x2019;s personal favorites, came even at the height of the Watergate scandal.<br><br>And so Mrs. Democrat and Mrs. Republican, as they were called in a Press Club comedy sketch in 1933, spent half a century engaged in an epic political battle while locked in familial embrace. During the height of the New Deal, it was not unusual for Alice to attack her Democratic cousins&#x2019; policies in the afternoon, via her syndicated newspaper column, then head over to the White House to join them for dinner. Their sparring could get painfully personal, given that both women staked a claim to the extraordinary, complicated, and sometimes contradictory legacy of Theodore Roo�se�velt. Before the Kennedys, the Bushes, or the Clintons, the Roo�se�velts showed just how close to a monarchy American democracy can veer. The name Roo�se�velt appeared on a national ticket an astonishing eight times in the twelve presidential elections from 1900 to 1944, and the extended Roo�se�velt family held dozens of elected and appointed positions at all levels of government throughout the twentieth century, right down to Franklin and Eleanor&#x2019;s son Elliott&#x2019;s term as mayor of Miami Beach in 1966.<br><br>But this was much more than a family feud. As the twentieth century became the American century, Alice and Eleanor became vocal symbols of the country&#x2019;s great debates. What was the right role for America on the world stage? The best way to prevent war? To address the gap between rich and poor? For that matter, what was the role of government&#x2014;�to shape society or get out of the way? Eleanor and Alice represented opposing sides on just about every one of those issues, and they fought for their beliefs&#x2014;�and against each other&#x2014;�as fiercely as any passionate partisan around. Typically, even their means of engagement were radically different. Eleanor was the dutiful but stubborn wife who used her First Lady status to fight for her beliefs in public, and even harder in private. Alice was more comfortable behind the scenes, wielding a whisper rather than a megaphone. But a few well-�chosen, carefully placed words from Mrs. L. could torpedo a campaign or give new hope to an underdog. The Republican presidential candidate Thomas Dewey, belittled by Alice as looking like &#x201c;the little man on the wedding cake,&#x201d; saw his political career gravely injured amid smirks and laughter. For all their differences, the cousins share part of at least one important legacy: they short-�circuited the twentieth century&#x2019;s rules of gender. Their roles as power players are all the more impressive given that they didn&#x2019;t even have the right to vote until they were thirty-�six.<br><br>Alice never explained why she didn&#x2019;t join the pilgrimage to Hyde Park to say good-�bye to Eleanor; after all, she rarely missed an opportunity to rub elbows with influential people. Some wondered if it was a parting shot, a final snub in a relationship often interrupted by stubborn, stony silences. But by the time Eleanor died, the personal barbs and caustic exchanges between the two cousins were largely a thing of the past. Like the late-�in-�life reconciliation between Adams and Jefferson 140 years earlier, the perspective of the passing years changed them. Their political passions never exactly cooled, but they boiled over less frequently amid the baggage of flawed marriages, difficult children, and the premature loss of parents and siblings. In those more human respects, Mrs. Democrat and Mrs. Republican found their lives mirroring each other in ways that must have astonished even them.<br><br>For Alice and Eleanor, their oil-�and-�water bond was something of a birthright, bequeathed to them from their respective fathers and beyond. Even though he was almost two years younger than Theodore, Elliott had long been the Roo�se�velt family&#x2019;s prime hope. Handsome and athletic, he was the favorite of his sisters and his mother, the kind of bighearted boy who would literally give you the clothes off his back, as he did one December when he saw a &#x201c;street urchin&#x201d; shivering in the New York cold and handed the boy his new overcoat. Elliott was seven. The family called him Nell, after the saintly Dickens character in The Old Curiosity Shop. Charm became his calling card. When he was twenty, Elliott took off on an around-�the-�world hunting excursion. On the ship from New York to England, he bumped into his distant cousins James and Sara Roo�se�velt, who were on their honeymoon. They became so taken with handsome, dashing, life-�of-�the-�party Elliott that they asked him to be the godfather to their first child, who was born a little more than a year later. They named him Franklin Delano Roo�se�velt, making Eleanor&#x2019;s father the godfather to her future husband.<br><br>The Roo�se�velt boys were intrepid adventurers, but they were plagued by health problems. Theodore was an asthmatic child who spent much of his earliest years indoors, playing dolls with his sisters or reading in bed. Elliott developed debilitating headaches and unexplained seizures that forced him to drop out of St. Paul&#x2019;s boarding school after one year. What made the brothers different was how they responded to their frailties. Theodore was determined and disciplined; he essentially worked and willed himself to health and to the apex of public life.<br><br>Elliott slid in the other direction. Always the bon vivant, he acquired a self-�destructive taste for liquor and women. The more his vices tarnished his status as the family golden boy, the more energy he poured into besting his big brother. If Teddy went to shoot big game out west, Elliott would go further&#x2014;�to hunt for tigers and elephants in India and the Himalayas. If Theodore married a great beauty, Elliott would snag a woman who was so breathtaking that the poet Robert Browning once asked to watch her portrait being painted, as a kind of inspiration. They could turn a garden-�variety sibling rivalry into something practically Shakespearean. When Alice and Eleanor were about four, their fathers competed against each other in a polo match that almost became a medieval joust. It was Teddy&#x2019;s Oyster Bay club versus Elliott&#x2019;s &#x201c;third-�rate&#x201d; Meadowbrook squad, as Theodore teasingly described them. With time running out, Teddy&#x2019;s side had the match locked up, leading 6&#x2013;�1, but that didn&#x2019;t stop him from taking off after Elliott when his little brother headed downfield at breakneck speed. Before anyone could see it coming, their horses collided. &#x201c;There was a thump of horseflesh as brother tried to ride brother out. Suddenly&#x2014;�no one saw how&#x2014;�Theodore was thrown,&#x201d; their younger sister, Corinne, wrote in a letter to their older sister, Anna. For several minutes he &#x201c;neither moved nor stirred, and looked like a dead man.&#x201d; When Theodore finally pulled himself up, he staggered around for hours and was unsteady on his feet for days. A week later, his wife, Edith, suffered a miscarriage.</p><h2>The New York Trilogy : City of Glass&#39;, &#39;Ghosts&#39; and &#39;Locked Room</h2><p>Three stories on the nature of identity.

He graduated from Columbia University with an MA degree. After travelling extensively for 4 years, Auster returned to New York in 1974 and began his career as a writer. Throughout the 1970s he wrote mainly poetry and essays which appeared in various magazines including the New York Review of Books. During the 1980s he concentrated on prose writing: a memoir and four novels were published. His screenplay, Smoke and Blue in the Face was published in April 1996 to coincide with the release of the film, and in 1999 Faber published the screenplayLulu on the Bridge. The Art of Hunger (a collection of essays, interviews and prose) and his Selected Poems were published in November 1998.

He has not, as far as I know, been presented with the literal object, traditionally an oversized five-pound gold-plated item, dispensed to visiting benefactors and favored natives on a dais in front of City Hall by a functionary in top hat and claw hammer coat, but I doubt he needs one of those. Auster&#x2019;s key is like the key to dreams or the key to the highway. It is an alchemical passe-partout that allows him to see through walls and around corners, that permits him entry to corridors and substrata and sealed houses nobody else notices, as well as to a field of variegated phenomena once considered discrete, but whose coherence Auster has established. This territory is a realm within New York City, a current that runs along its streets, within its office buildings and apartment houses and helter-skelter through its parks&#x2014;a force field charged by synchronicity and overlap, perhaps invisible but inarguably there, although it was never identified as such before Auster planted his flag.</p><p>Auster&#x2019;s characters peregrinate along this corridor as if it were a moving sidewalk, or like the dream subway devised by the cartoonist Ben Katchor, which stops in individual apartments. Quinn, in City of Glass, and Blue, in Ghosts, both stumble into it, to their enlightenment and discomfiture, and the unseen Fanshawe, in The Locked Room, has gone to live there&#x2014;the question is whether any of them is able to emerge from it. If you have spent time in New York City and fully engaged with the place, chances are that you will have caught glimpses of that space-time continuum. You will have noticed certain cryptic graffiti, certain glossolaliac manifestos crammed onto photocopied sheets that you did not understand because they were written in the language of that slipstream. You will have wondered about various street characters&#x2014;itinerant performers and site-specific eccentrics and inexplicable middle-of-the-night apparitions&#x2014;who are, it turns out, commuters from that realm into the workaday world. But it may be, in fact, the essence of the city, while what passes for the city in the average experience is nothing more than a thin coat of paint.</p><p>Auster&#x2019;s characters know that you can practice a form of divination by reading the sidewalks, that capricious telephone calls can link people in ways that may seem random but end up sealing their fates, that you can pass through the streets completely unseen while making no special effort to disguise yourself or hide, that you can pass through your life in the city without leaving any more of a mark than if you had never been born, that you probably have a double out there somewhere among the eight million whose life runs such a close parallel to yours that the lines never converge&#x2014;although if they ever do: beware. These things prove that the city has been around for millennia, although it was not always located at the mouth of the Hudson River, or even in North America. It was not even always a city. For a long time it was known as a forest. It was, in fact, the primeval forest, inhabited by trickster foxes and stolid pigs and woebegone wolves and the occasional shape-shifting human, but it was recognizably the same labyrinth of chance.</p><p>The chief difference between Auster&#x2019;s city and that forest is that the trees have become buildings and their leaves have become paper. The paper is covered with writing and gathered into manuscripts and notebooks, of preference red. Some of these are eventually transubstantiated into printed books, but often they subsist as manuscripts and notebooks, which usually find a readership of one besides their authors. Their contents are often cryptic, often coded, sometimes dull, sometimes so disturbing that their readers cannot responsibly give an account but can respond only by destroying them. Those manuscripts and notebooks that cannot be published usually have the deepest connection with the truth, and that truth is either arcane and difficult to perceive or else it is painful enough to be considered an abomination.</p><p>Fates pivot on these unread texts, which are in each case the focus or the result of an inquiry by a metaphysical detective. These detectives may bear a superficial or circumstantial resemblance to the classic detectives of the eponymous genre of fiction&#x2014;about the same kind of resemblance that those characters in turn have to actual workaday investigators&#x2014;but in essence Auster&#x2019;s detectives are pilgrims, questers. They would be more immediately recognizable in the forest, striding along with staff in hand and bindle on back, maybe whistling to keep the shadows at bay. And like the blameless pilgrim who ventures forth into the forest with resolve but not without qualms, the detective ultimately finds that his mission has led him through the labyrinth on a path that describes an irregular circle.</p><p>There is also an author, who appears in each of the novels, who may or may not be called &#x201c;Paul Auster&#x201d; and may or may not share personality traits or biographical elements with the person whose name appears on the spine. He is, in the finest tradition, merely a witness, moved to transmit the story while maintaining a measured reserve. Or is he perhaps the central character, setting up a lookalike as a blind to cover the degree of his involvement? Auster encourages this line of speculation, which is a labyrinth of another sort and bears a pedigree which&#x2014;as he reminds us, riffing under his own name on the conundrum of Don Quixote&#x2014;far predates postmodernism. If the city is a forest and the detective is a pilgrim, the author is a pilgrim as well. He is the one who makes it out alive, who can exchange his story for supper and a bed of straw.</p><p>There have been, in two hundred years, a great many novels and stories set in New York City, but until Paul Auster&#x2019;s trilogy no one had made a serious effort to demonstrate its extreme antiquity, its surface flimsiness compared to its massive subterranean depths, its claim on the origins of stories far older than written culture. But now we know, and that truth will inhere no matter how many times the city is reconfigured and how thoroughly living memory is banished from it. Auster, who owns the key, makes its use available to all readers.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>CITY OF GLASS</p><p>It was a wrong number that started it...<br>by PAUL AUSTER</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p></p><p></p><p>It was a wrong number that started it, the telephone ringing three times in the dead of night, and the voice on the other end asking for someone he was not. Much later, when he was able to think about the things that happened to him, he would conclude that nothing was real except chance. But that was much later. In the beginning, there was simply the event and its consequences. Whether it might have turned out differently, or whether it was all predetermined with the first word that came from the stranger&#x2019;s mouth, is not the question. The question is the story itself, and whether or not it means something is not for the story to tell.</p><p>As for Quinn, there is little that need detain us. Who he was, where he came from, and what he did are of no great importance. We know, for example, that he was thirty-five years old. We know that he had once been married, had once been a father, and that both his wife and son were now dead. We also know that he wrote books. To be precise, we know that he wrote mystery novels. These works were written under the name of William Wilson, and he produced them at the rate of about one a year, which brought in enough money for him to live modestly in a small New York apartment. Because he spent no more than five or six months on a novel, for the rest of the year he was free to do as he wished. He read many books, he looked at paintings, he went to the movies. In the summer he watched baseball on television; in the winter he went to the opera. More than anything else, however, what he liked to do was walk. Nearly every day, rain or shine, hot or cold, he would leave his apartment to walk through the city&#x2014;never really going anywhere, but simply going wherever his legs happened to take him.</p><p>New York was an inexhaustible space, a labyrinth of endless steps, and no matter how far he walked, no matter how well he came to know its neighborhoods and streets, it always left him with the feeling of being lost. Lost, not only in the city, but within himself as well. Each time he took a walk, he felt as though he were leaving himself behind, and by giving himself up to the movement of the streets, by reducing himself to a seeing eye, he was able to escape the obligation to think, and this, more than anything else, brought him a measure of peace, a salutary emptiness within. The world was outside of him, around him, before him, and the speed with which it kept changing made it impossible for him to dwell on any one thing for very long. Motion was of the essence, the act of putting one foot in front of the other and allowing himself to follow the drift of his own body. By wandering aimlessly, all places became equal, and it no longer mattered where he was. On his best walks, he was able to feel that he was nowhere. And this, finally, was all he ever asked of things: to be nowhere. New York was the nowhere he had built around himself, and he realized that he had no intention of ever leaving it again.</p><p>In the past, Quinn had been more ambitious. As a young man he had published several books of poetry, had written plays, critical essays, and had worked on a number of long translations. But quite abruptly, he had given up all that. A part of him had died, he told his friends, and he did not want it coming back to haunt him. It was then that he had taken on the name of William Wilson. Quinn was no longer that part of him that could write books, and although in many ways Quinn continued to exist, he no longer existed for anyone but himself.</p><p>He had continued to write because it was the only thing he felt he could do. Mystery novels seemed a reasonable solution. He had little trouble inventing the intricate stories they required, and he wrote well, often in spite of himself, as if without having to make an effort. Because he did not consider himself to be the author of what he wrote, he did not feel responsible for it and therefore was not compelled to defend it in his heart. William Wilson, after all, was an invention, and even though he had been born within Quinn himself, he now led an independent life. Quinn treated him with deference, at times even admiration, but he never went so far as to believe that he and William Wilson were the same man. It was for this reason that he did not emerge from behind the mask of his pseudonym. He had an agent, but they had never met. Their contacts were confined to the mail, for which purpose Quinn had rented a numbered box at the post office. The same was true of the publisher, who paid all fees, monies, and royalties to Quinn through the agent. No book by William Wilson ever included an author&#x2019;s photograph or biographical note. William Wilson was not listed in any writers&#x2019; directory, he did not give interviews, and all the letters he received were answered by his agent&#x2019;s secretary. As far as Quinn could tell, no one knew his secret. In the beginning, when his friends learned that he had given up writing, they would ask him how he was planning to live. He told them all the same thing: that he had inherited a trust fund from his wife. But the fact was that his wife had never had any money. And the fact was that he no longer had any friends.</p><p>It had been more than five years now. He did not think about his son very much anymore, and only recently he had removed the photograph of his wife from the wall. Every once in a while, he would suddenly feel what it had been like to hold the three-year-old boy in his arms&#x2014;but that was not exactly thinking, nor was it even remembering. It was a physical sensation, an imprint of the past that had been left in his body, and he had no control over it. These moments came less often now, and for the most part it seemed as though things had begun to change for him. He no longer wished to be dead. At the same time, it cannot be said that he was glad to be alive. But at least he did not resent it. He was alive, and the stubbornness of this fact had little by little begun to fascinate him&#x2014;as if he had managed to outlive himself, as if he w...</p></p><h2>The Man Who Walked Through Time</h2><p>The remarkable classic of nature writing by the first man ever to have walked the entire length of the Grand Canyon.</p><p>Colin Fletcher is a self-described "compulsive walker." It is not unusual for him to pick up a map, drive to an area that intrigues him, and then start walking. It should come as no surprise then that a detour from U.S. 66 to visit the Grand Canyon on a June morning in 1963 inspired Fletcher to walk the length of the Canyon below the rim. In <i>The Man Who Walked Through Time</i> Fletcher recounts his amazing journey. For two months Fletcher struggled against heat and cold, lack of water and dwindling supplies. The terrain was, at times, nearly impassible, yet despite the physical hardships, Fletcher came away from his experience with a new awareness of how humans fit into the vast scheme of things. He writes, for example, of meeting a rattlesnake on Beaver Sand Bar: "Now I am no rattlesnake <i>aficionado</i>. The first rattler I met scared me purple, and killing it seemed a human duty.... Yet by the end of that California summer I no longer felt an unreasoning fear of rattlers.... Instead, I accepted them as organisms with a niche in the web of life. Accepted them, that is, as fellow creatures."<p> <i>The Man Who Walked Through Time</i> is a remarkable account of a journey both physical and spiritual. It is also a record of the Grand Canyon as it was before the massive influx of tourism. Fletcher's descriptions of the spectacular geography, the wildlife, and the remnants of much older cultures serve to remind us that the Grand Canyon has been around longer than humankind and may well outlast us.</p>7 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Grant</h2><p>Arguing that Grant has been underrated by historians, a celebrated biographer and author of John Marshall: Definer of a Nation seeks to correct the record with this new assessment of the celebrated Civil War general and Reconstruction-era president. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Hiram Ulysses Grant--mistakenly enrolled in the United States Military Academy as Ulysses Simpson Grant, and so known ever since--was a failure in many of the things to which he turned his hand. An indifferent, somewhat undisciplined cadet who showed talent for mathematics and painting, he served with unexpected distinction in the U.S. war against Mexico, then repeatedly went broke as a real-estate speculator, freighter, and farmer. His reputation was restored in the Civil War, in which he fulfilled a homespun philosophy of battle: "Find out where your enemy is. Get at him as soon as you can. Strike him as hard as you can and as often as you can, and keep moving on." Given to dark moods and the solace of the bottle (although far less so than his political foes made him out to be), Grant was ferocious in war, but chivalrous in peace, and offered generous terms to the defeated armies of Robert E. Lee. His enemies on the battlefield of politics showed him little honor, and they had a point: Grant's presidency was marked by a legion of corrupt lieutenants and hangers-on who built their fortunes on the back of a suffering people, and for whose actions Grant's reputation long has suffered.<p> Recent history has been kinder to Grant than were the chroniclers of his day, not only for his undoubted abilities as a military leader, but also for his conduct as a president who sought to rebuild a shattered nation. Jean Edward Smith, the author of fine biographies of John Marshall and Lucius D. Clay, offers compelling reasons to accept this program of revision, while acknowledging the shortcomings of Grant's administration. Surely and thoughtfully written, this sprawling but swiftly moving book stands as a true hallmark in the literature that is devoted to Grant. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Jean Edward Smith</b> is the author of numerous works of history and biography, including <i>John Marshall: Definer of a Nation</i> and <i>Lucius D.

The white robe was the traditional garb for candidates, as every child on Pern knew from the Teaching Ballads. <br><br>Cristov suddenly realized that his heart was racing, his throat dry. In not much longer than it took D&#x2019;vin&#x2019;s bronze dragon to go between&#x2014;no more time than it took to cough three times&#x2014;Cristov went from being a miner recovering from an injury to being a candidate for a Hatching. <br><br>This can&#x2019;t be happening, he thought. It should have been Pellar. <br><br>Pellar was the mute Harper who had rescued Cristov when his mine had collapsed, had saved Cristov when Tenim had purposely exploded the old firestone mine, and who had had a fire-lizard before Tenim&#x2019;s hunting bird had killed it&#x2014;and had nearly killed Pellar, as well. <br><br>Pellar deserved to be a candidate . . . but Pellar had insisted upon remaining at the newly named Fire Hold to help the young holdless girl, Halla, manage the Shunned of Pern to redeem their honor by mining the firestone of Pern.<br><br> &#x201c;Cristov!&#x201d; The voice, close by his ear, startled him. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re here! Excellent!&#x201d; <br><br>Cristov&#x2019;s eyes widened as he recognized Kindan. Turns back, he and Kindan had been enemies. Back then, Cristov had despised watch-whers, just as he&#x2019;d been taught by his father. Kindan&#x2019;s father had been a wherhandler, a person bonded to the ugly night-loving creatures who were only distant cousins to the great dragons that protected Pern. Infected by his father&#x2019;s attitudes, Cristov had despised Kindan, and they&#x2019;d fought many times as youngsters. In the end, however, Cristov had realized that it was Kindan who had been right and his father who had been wrong&#x2014;and Cristov had found himself, at an early age, making a grown man&#x2019;s choice and doing what was right instead of what was expected. He&#x2019;d even come to regard the ugly watch-whers with respect bordering on awe. And now he greeted Kindan with a huge grin. <br><br>Kindan saw the robe clasped in Cristov&#x2019;s hand and his eyebrows rose. He held up his hand and showed Cristov that he, too, had the white robe of a candidate. <br><br>&#x201c;Great, we can go together,&#x201d; he said to Cristov, as he pulled his robe over his head and tied it with the white belt.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you wanted to be a harper,&#x201d; Cristov said in surprise. <br><br>&#x201c;Harpers can be dragonriders, too,&#x201d; Kindan replied with a big grin. <br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be certain to Impress, after your watch-wher,&#x201d; Cristov said. &#x201c;Probably a bronze, too!&#x201d; <br><br>Kindan shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just be happy to Impress,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave the bronzes to you.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Cristov, Kindan, hurry!&#x201d; <br><br>They both turned and saw Sonia, the healer&#x2019;s daughter, also dressed in white robes. &#x201c;Oh, I do hope that egg&#x2019;s a queen!&#x201d; <br><br>Cristov knew that Sonia had been eyeing the funnily marked egg on the Hatching Grounds for some time. Traditionally, though, the queen dragon would carefully push aside any queen eggs, and Jessala&#x2019;s Garirth hadn&#x2019;t done so. <br><br>In fact, the egg looked so odd that the Weyr&#x2019;s healer, Sonia&#x2019;s father S&#x2019;son, had been asked to examine it to be sure it was whole. <br><br>Garirth was so old that her gold hide was a mere pale yellow, and Jessala, her rider, was so pained with age that she rarely moved from her quarters. It was entirely possible that age had caused this egg to have come out wrong somehow. But S&#x2019;son had declared it fine. <br><br>D&#x2019;vin gestured for them to go forward, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll watch from the stands!&#x201d;<br><br>Together the three moved to join the other candidates on the Hatching Grounds. <br><br>There were only twenty-three eggs on the Grounds. Cristov had learned that traditionally a queen would lay as few as thirty and as many as forty or more eggs. That Garirth had lain so few was a further indication of her extreme age.<br><br>Sonia, who had been examining the other candidates carefully, groaned. &#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t enough candidates! There are only twenty boys and twenty-two eggs. And there are no other girls, either.&#x201d; <br><br>A rush of cold air from dragon wings startled them and they turned to see a smattering of boys and girls rush forward, dressed in white robes. <br><br>&#x201c;Those are Benden colors,&#x201d; Sonia said, pointing to a dragonrider waving in the distance. &#x201c;B&#x2019;ralar must have sent for them.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s M&#x2019;tal!&#x201d; Kindan exclaimed, waving excitedly to the Benden Weyrleader. M&#x2019;tal waved back and gave him a thumbs-up for good luck. <br><br>&#x201c;What if one of the Benden girls Impresses the queen?&#x201d; Cristov asked. <br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll stay here,&#x201d; Sonia said. &#x201c;But I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if she found herself Weyrwoman at the moment of Hatching.&#x201d; She cast a worried look at Garirth, whose head lolled listlessly on the ground beyond them. &#x201c;I think Garirth and Jessala are only waiting for the hatchlings before they go between forever; they&#x2019;re both so tired with age.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Skystone (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 1)</h2><p>The first in a six-volume series that chronicles the legend of Arthur, King of the Britons, explores the turbulent world of Roman-occupied Britain, as two Romans struggle to build lives in a land savaged by warring Picts, Celts, and invading Saxons. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Praise for Jack Whyte and <i>The Camulod Chronicles</i>:<p> "Jack Whyte is a master storyteller....

The British are losing a bitter war against the Boers while the German kaiser is busy building a vast new navy. The United States is struggling to put down an insurgency in the South Pacific while the upstart imperialist Japan begins to make clear to neighboring Russia its territorial ambition. In China, a perennial pawn in the Great Game, a mysterious group of superstitious peasants is launching attacks on the Western powers they fear are corrupting their country. These ordinary Chinese&#x2015;called Boxers by the West because of their martial arts showmanship&#x2015;rise up, seemingly out of nowhere. Foreshadowing the insurgencies of the more recent past, they lack a centralized leadership and instead tap into latent nationalism and deep economic frustration to build their army. Their battle cry: "Support the Qing, exterminate the foreigners."</p><p>Many scholars brush off the Boxers as an ill-conceived and easily defeated revolt, but the military historian David J. Silbey shows just how close they came to beating back the combined might of all the imperial powers. Drawing on the diaries and letters of allied soldiers and diplomats, Silbey paints a vivid portrait of the short-lived war. Even though their cause ended just as quickly as it began, the bravery and patriotism of the Boxers would inspire Chinese nationalists&#x2015;including a young Mao Zedong&#x2015;for decades to come.</p></p><p><p>David J.

Colonial Style provides both inspiration and practical advice to homeowners looking to increase their home&#39;s livability while retaining its classic charm. The book explains the differences between three styles - Colonial, Cape Cod, and Saltbox - and chapters cover doors and windows, trim work, built-ins, floor and wall treatments, paint colors, and incorporating today&#39;s kitchens and baths into a timeless colonial interior.</p><p>This book is for homeowners who appreciate the historic character of their old house, whether Colonial, Cape Cod, or Saltbox style. The numerous examples are from actual homeowners who updated their 17th or 18th century homes with a sense of the past without sacrificing modern amenities or luxuries. It is meant to inspire homeowners to learn about the inherent qualities of these older homes while making it loveable and liveable for themselves in the 21st century.Nostalgia for a past that "was simpler, somehow better" has led to the enduring popularity of Colonial-style architecture and decor, writes Crochet (<i>Designer's Guide to Furniture Styles</i>). While new Colonial-style houses are being built across the country, older homes are being restored to their past glory. Focusing on three house styles from the 17th and 18th centuries&#x2014;Colonial, Cape Cod and Saltbox&#x2014;Crochet shows readers how such homes can retain historically accurate features while accommodating modern needs. Without being too much of a purist (she advocates knocking down interior walls if a house feels claustrophobic), Crochet stresses the importance of creating a unified look: she's particularly keen on concealing televisions, microwaves and sinks by adapting period pieces of furniture to house them. While restoration buffs will relish the book's details on such things as quirk bead molding, gunstock corner posts and strap hinges, those seeking to bring some history to a newer home will find hints on incorporating salvaged floorboards or recreating authentic-looking plaster walls and wood paneling. Although the book is generally helpful and looks beautiful, it's marred by poor editing: some writing is sloppy, and repetitions abound (must we be repeatedly told, for instance, that decorative molding was more ornate in public rooms than in kitchens and servants' quarters?). Still, Crochet's enthusiasm for her subject is evident, and her vast knowledge will please historically minded homeowners. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Richly detailed charcoal drawings fill the pages of this beautifully conceived book. Particularly striking are the faces of the Russian Jewish immigrant families who people the pages. The only color used is in the babushka and dress of Great-Gramma Anna, which become part of a brightly hued quilt. Following that quilt through four generations is the basis of this account. Customs and fashions change, but family is constant, visually linked by the ``keeping quilt.'' Children will be fascinated by the various uses to which the quilt is put, although some of those uses make one wonder how its ``like-new'' shape was maintained. That stretch of the imagination is gentle, however, and does not mar the story. Readers who notice that the author and the narrator share the same name may realize that this lovely story is true; that should make it even more appealing.

Plus, all the lame jazz that&#x2019;s going on in their lives. &#x201c;Had a great time in Memphis.&#x201d; &#x201c;Bobby lost his retainer down a storm drain.&#x201d; &#x201c;I think the neighbors are dealing drugs.&#x201d; But this letter is different.

Hmmm. That&#x2019;s odd: Nobody&#x2019;s stopping us from saying &#x201c;Merry Christmas.&#x201d; Then I did some research, and it turns out the real war is against people saying, &#x201c;Happy Holidays.&#x201d; The nerve: trying to be inclusive.

A product of the rough and tumble political journalism of the day, Garrison wrote with extreme passion and from an uncompromising point of view. Yet the man who emerges from the pages of <i>All on Fire</i> is a deeply thoughtful person who, despite barely escaping lynch mobs himself, had a great sense of humor and a very polite demeanor. Historians have tended to minimize Garrison's impact on America, and some consider him a fringe character. But Henry Meyer, in this hefty biography, places Garrison at the center of his century, noting that Garrison's thought and tactics influenced not only the country's changing view of slavery, but also inspired the incipient feminist movement. The Lincoln administration noted Garrison's influence by inviting him to help raise the flag over the recaptured Fort Sumter. <i>All on Fire</i> goes into great detail on Garrison's life and work, providing the close and copious examination this activist's life fully deserves. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Praise for <i>All on Fire</i> by Henry Mayer: <p>"A magnificant portrait of Garrison, filled with fresh insights into the man and his movement and written with unsurpassed narrative elegance. It is the best biography of the great abolitionist crusader I have ever read." --Stephen B. Oates, author of <i>The Approaching Fury: Voices of the Storm, 1820-1861</i> </p><p>"This eloquent, powerful biography by Henry Mayer should restore [Garrison] to the position he held in the country before the Civil War--a thundering voice challenging the conscience of white America. It is a book that may well encourage and inspire the coming generations to do for our time what Garrison did for his." --Howard Zinn, author of <i>A People's History of the United States</i> </p><p>"William Lloyd Garrison...stirred the conscience of millions and--more than anyone--helped move the issue of slavery to the top of the political agenda. Without him, Lincoln might not have had his chance for greatness. This comprehensive work, for the first time, does him justice--beautifully." --Mario M. Cuomo, author of <i>Lincoln on Democracy</i> </p><p>"This is a masterpiece. Brilliantly written and intelligently constructed, Mayer's elegant presentation rightly places William Lloyd Garrison at the forefront of America's greatest heroes." --Annette Gordon-Reed, author of <i>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings</i> </p><p>"The narrative pace of the story and the fine writing style provide us with an excellent portrait not only of Garrison, but of all of the other people whom he affected." --John A. Garraty, author of <i>The American Nation</i> </p><p>"As history, as narrative, as moral testament, as witness in a grand, old-fashioned sense that Garrison himself would surely love, it's a spectacular achievement." --Jonathan Kozol, author of <i>Amazing Grace</i></p></p><h2>At Home in North Branch (Grandma&#39;s Attic Series)</h2><p>Mabel finds life as a minister&#39;s wife in a small Michigan farming community brings many joys as well as many tribulations.</p><p></p><h2>Shackleton&#39;s Captain: A Biography of Frank Worsley</h2><p>Frank Worsley shared with Sir Ernest Shackleton one of the greatest adventures of the Heroic Age of Antarctic explorartion. After their ship Endurance was crushed in the ice in 1915, they made what is perhaps the most famous small-boat journey in history, across 800 miles of the world&#39;s roughest seas to get help. Worsley&#39;s diaries and notes still provide the main records of that journey, yet the fame of Shackleton rather overshadowed the modest New Zealander. This first ever biography of Worsley sets out to restore the balance. It tells the full story of his extraordinary life, from childhood as a larrikin in Akaroa, New Zealand, to his apprenticeship at sea, and the devolpment of his remarkable skills as navigator and sailing master. It also backgrounds the particular friendship that fourished betweeen Worsley and Shackleton.

Carl Hiaasen closes down the party, and in between, 11 of Florida's literati, including Elmore Leonard, John Dufresne, and Edna Buchanan, make twisted offerings to the affair: three severed heads, all bearing a remarkable resemblance to Fidel Castro; four murders; some sex; some espionage; even an appearance by Jimmy Carter and one by Castro himself. <p> Originally published as a serial novel in the <i>Miami Herald's Tropic</i> magazine, <i>Naked Came the Manatee</i> resembles a literary game of telephone, with each writer contributing a chapter and passing it on to the next, who then makes the most of what he or she is given. The result is a novel with wildly fluctuating styles and more crazy plot curves than a daytime drama, but thanks to these 13 masters of the craft this roller coaster of a book is almost as much fun to read as it obviously was to write.</p>Boy is this book a thrill-ride. The concept, having all your favorite mystery writers take turns with the chapters is one thing, the execution is another!

Stories, told and retold, embedded in the texture of culture and community, collected and studied for many decades, are here translated and made available to the general reader for the first time. The figure of the wise woman, the hag, the Cailleach, or the Red Woman are part of an oral tradition which has its roots in pre-Christian Ireland. In the hands of Gearoid O Crualaich, these figures are subtly explored to reveal how they offered a complex understanding of the world, of human psychology and its predicaments: the thematic structure of the book brings to the fore universal themes such as death, marriage, childbirth, and healing, and invites the reader to see the contemporary relevance of the stories for themselves.<br><br></p><p>Gear�id � Crualaoich is Professor Folklore and Ethnology in University College Cork and is regarded as one of the most original thinkers in these fields. He is the author of numerous academic articles and leading authority on the Cailleach."This is a breathtaking book. It returns to Irish folk material the emotional depth and imaginative meaning which it always contained in its natural context but of which it has often been stripped by the more utilitarian and commonplace interpretations long in fashion. It reminds me once again why I am charmed and enchanted by this material, and more than that, why I regularly find in it answers to the deep-seated obsessions of my own. A real gem of a book, containing an exemplary methodology showing how the Irish folk tradition can be interrogated to find answers which are vitally important to our age and times." (Nuala N� Dhomhnaill)<br><br>&#x201c;The unearthing of a priceless spirit from forgotten, buried, misunderstood storytelling is like discovering Knowth or Newgrange and opening the doors to those otherworlds. Gear�id � Crualaoich&#x2019;s work on the wise-woman healer, the cailleach, is of immense importance, for we need access to the secrets of healing and orientation in life known well in the past but now neglected. Without that secret knowledge we are left with mere rationalism and secularism, which are inadequate for dealing with the challenges of a complex world. This book is highly professional, comprehensive, carefully interpretive, and respectful. It opens up many avenues toward the healing of our personal lives and our world. It is of special importance to Ireland, but it also addresses the needs of people around the world, who can know look to Ireland for the rediscovery of a special kind of spiritual knowledge connected to the natural world, to place, and to history. This book is so rich in detail and implication that it can be taken by the reader as a personal map to the otherworld and to the forgotten powers of nature and humanity now acessible to him. To women especially it offers an image of strength, wisdom, and healing power. We need this kind of excellent work, visionary as well as academic, all over the world to pull us out of the literalistic and materialistic vision that is limiting us and perhaps even killing us.&#x201d; (Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul and The Soul&#x2019;s Religion)</p><h2>Williamsburg Christmas: The Story of Decoration in the Colonial Capital</h2><p>A nostalgic celebration of the colonial Christmas shows the many faces of the season in Williamsburg over the last three hundred years, focusing on the wreaths, swags, and other adornments used to decorate doors, windows, staircases, and tabletops.</p><p></p><h2>UnCivilization: Urban Geopolitics in a Time of Chaos</h2><p><b>When do civilizations begin ... and end?</b> And how? Is this what we are witnessing as the 21st Century matures? And as a totally new global architecture presents us with an unrecognizable world? What does it all mean for the stability of nations-states, the prosperity of societies, the way we live and wage wars over the coming decades? This study in Grand Strategy, <i>Uncivilization: Urban Geopolitics in a Time of Chaos</i>, outlines how we are already entering an age in which global population levels will begin to decline substantially, even as urbanization and economically- and security-driven transnational migration gather pace. Population decline and movement patterns are also intersecting with economic, scientific, and power projection patterns, while urban social attitudes - the politics of urban societies - have created a revolutionary new political, social, and strategic reality. And <i>urban man</i> has also become <i>electrical man</i>, totally dependent on modern forms of energy. So the book looks at how energy dependency patterns are changing the opportunities and vulnerabilities of society. And the author, with five decades of work in military, intelligence and security studies, looks at how future warfare will be conducted, including cyber warfare and intelligence, and in the area of global logistics. <i>This book shows that changes in the global strategic architecture mean that we really are engaged in an entirely new game. And it's time to learn the rules.</i></p><p>Gregory Copley, an Australian, born in Perth, Western Australia, has served as an adviser on strategic issues to a number of governments and leaders.

It was hailed as the finest translation of the 20th Century, approved for liturgical use and was endorsed by Pope Pius XII, Archbishop Fulton Sheen and many more. <br><br> In the early 20th century, Msgr. Ronald Knox embarked on an entirely new English Bible. He wanted a Bible that did not merely translate the original but made it read as if an Englishman had written it. His translation is spiritual and literary, graceful and lyrical, making it one of the most beautiful vernacular versions of the Holy Bible. <br><br> The unique features of the Knox Bible are: <br><br> - Translated from the Latin Vulgate and compared with the Greek and Hebrew texts single handedly by Ronald Knox over nine years. <br><br> - Uses timeless English, which is both sacral and reverent. <br><br> - Set in a single-column format with verse references placed at the side of the text in order to provide a clear and easily readable Bible. <br><br> -The full Bible is now available again for the first time in over 50 years, in an edition from Baronius Press, beautifully bound in leather with gilt edges. <br><br> - Included with this new edition is a paperback edition of On Englishing the Bible (5.5" x 8", 72 pages) in which Msgr. Knox describes his account of the ordeal, which manages to be both illuminating and full of his wit. Anyone wishing to know more about Knox's translation and the problems involved in rendering the sacred Scriptures into the vernacular will be fascinated to hear from the translator himself how he tackled this mammoth project.</p><p>C. S. Lewis called him "the wittiest man in Europe," and Ronald Knox was a deft apologist, an astute translator of the Bible, and the preacher for occasions great and small throughout the first half of the twentieth century in England. <br><br>Born in 1888, as the sixth child of the Anglican Bishop of Manchester, he grew up in what he called "that form of Protestant piety which the modern world half regrets, half derides as 'old-fashioned.'" By the time he was 12 he was already writing Latin poetry.<br><br>Having won almost every attainable honour at Oxford, at just 24, Knox became the Anglican chaplain of Oxford's Trinity College. While he seemed to be content with preaching, talking, and writing, his soul was not at peace.<br><br>Five years later, in 1917, Ronald Knox resigned and entered the Roman Catholic Church. "Authority played a large part in my belief," he said later. In Knox's case, his break with the Church of England also meant a permanent break with his father, who had previously regarded him as his favourite son.<br><br>Knox was ordained to the priesthood, and soon he was back at Oxford, this time as a Catholic chaplain. Father Knox for 13 years made his rooms a gathering place for the university's most glittering wits. While he was there, he began churning out acclaimed and smoothly written detective novels (six within ten years) such as The Body in the Silo and The Viaduct Murder , which helped supplement his modest chaplaincy funds.<br><br> Towards the end of his chaplaincy at Oxford in 1939, Evelyn Waugh recounted that Knox was at a low ebb. At that point the English hierarchy commissioned Knox to single-handedly translate the New Testament.<br><br> From the beginning Knox assumed he would complete the entire Bible, which led to misunderstandings with the hierarchy, which were magnified by some opposition to the translation as it progressed. To complete the arduous task, Knox accepted the offer of the young converts, Lord and Lady Aston to retreat to their tranquil country hall, Aldenham Park.<br><br>There, with hands on his trusted typewriter and pipe in mouth, he produced on average twenty-four translated verses a day. He would not emerge until nine years later, when finally in the Autumn of 1948, the final verses were completed.<br><br>Knox's bible received great acclaim when it was first published. Time magazine called Knox the man who made the great 20th century bible. <br><br>Knox died in 1957 with many high honours attached to his name, having become a Fellow of both Trinity and Balliol colleges, and a Protonotary Apostolic to Pope Pius XII.A beautifully bound volume, I find myself responding with fresh eyes to the layout, which is formatted like prose, and the minimal distraction of footnotes. This is not a study bible; it's a reading bible, and Knox's language pulls us into the scriptural stories and images we know so very well and then elevates us with its staggering beauty. ... Yes, I read it and I wept. Not in fear, not in despair, but in consolation at the reminder, rendered so beautifully by Knox, that the world has resided in the madness of sin and shadow since Eden, but we are never abandoned, and need never be afraid. <br><i>- Gratefully weeping through the Knox Bible - Elizabeth Scalia in First Things, 2012</i> <br><br>Knox's rendition is an unusual combination of dynamic-equivalence translation and high literary quality. Many Bible readers prefer word-for-word (formal equivalence) translation to paraphrasing (dynamic equivalence) translation for theological reasons: They believe a literal translation brings them closer to ipsissima verba Dei. But there is often another, non-theological reason for their preference: Most dynamic-equivalence translations come across as banal in their phrasing. (The notable exceptions have been the New English Bible and its progeny, the Revised English Bible, which have been criticized for using an excessively high register, making the Bible sound like the conversation at a toffs' garden party.) Knox's version is free, but of high literary quality, and repays the attention even of people who prefer a more literal approach. <br><i>- "A Classic Translation Back in Print" - Michael Potemra, National Review</i> <br><br>Others will tell you about the virtues of the text and its translator; I ll just say that this edition is physically beautiful. The cover, the pages, the type ... all make for an impressive whole. It will undoubtedly become many people s go to gift book. First Communions, Confirmations, Marriages, Ordinations, Christmas, Easter ... as Catholics we have so many wonderful occasions for giving beautiful things to those we love! And it s my fervent wish that every priest should have one, especially in this Year of Faith. <br><i>- The Ronald Knox Society of North America</i> --The Ronald Knox Society of North America<br><br>The Knox Bible is one of the crown jewels of English Catholicism, a translation that does justice to the Latin Vulgate while avoiding the clumsy nature of its vernacular predecessors. While you can never judge a book by its cover, sometimes how a book looks is a good indicator of what s inside. Simply put, this is how a Bible is supposed to look, feel, and be. The leather binding shows a high degree of care and communicates that this is a book which is meant to last countless uses. The Bible is supposed to invite the reader to engage with it after a hard day at work. In fact, Bible s should be inviting particularly because it is in our hardest times that we need them most. Similarly, the beautiful ribbon, single-columned text, and golden edges enhance a sense of worth and usefulness to the book. This is a book I wouldn t mind passing on to my children as a family heirloom. <br> --Michael Reer, The Whiskey Catholic, April 2013<br><br>One interesting feature of the Knox Bible is its attention to detail with some of the psalms. In the original Hebrew, some psalms take the form of an alphabetical acrostic the first letter of each verse is ordered such that they read from the beginning to the end of the Hebrew alphabet. This is believed to indicate a completeness in thought, similar to the idea that Christ is the alpha and the omega. When translating into English (or any other language), this quality is lost. However, Msgr. Knox took good care with these alphabetical acrostics, providing translations which maintain this ordering in a beautiful English rendering. <br> --Allie Terrell, Ignitum Today<br><br>Instead of finding English word equivalents Knox asks How would an Englishman say this? Unlike committees which often make silly pre-fab decisions to always translate Greek word x with English word y, Knox transposes the idioms, the formality, and tone. And while it may seem like a silly thing to say, Knox is actually fluent in English the way few other translators seem to be. He understands slang as well as poetry. This allows him to remain much more faithful to the original and to English simultaneously. The results can be sumptuous. Consider Lamentations 2:18 Round those inviolable defenses, cry they upon the Lord in good earnest. Day and night, Sion, let thy tears stream down; never rest thou, never let that eye weary of its task. Prophetic and ancient-sounding as the text demands, but also recognizably English. <br> --Why Can't Catholics Speak English, (published in The American Conservative State of the Union)</p><h2>If You Take a Mouse to the Movies</h2><p>The famous little mouse from the children&#39;s classic If You Give a Mouse a Cookie is back in another irresistible tale full of holiday antics.

Beginning with the legendary 11th&#x2013;century doctor Robert J. Cole, each eldest son has borne the same name and middle initial, and some have possessed the uncanny &#x201c;sixth sense&#x201d;known as The Gift: the terrible and instinctive knowledge that someone is about to die.

The first time R.J. defies her beloved father is when she is born a female; the second, when she chooses to study law rather than medicine. Yet destiny is to overtake her when R.J. realizes that she has inherited The Gift. As she holds the hands of a sick man, R.J. feels a dreadful certainty that he is going to die; tragically, he is her own lover. Struggling with her grief, R.J. knows she must bow to the inevitable and become a physician.

The present text follows the first Spanish edition published by Destino, Barcelona, 1974, which bears a few minor variants, mainly in paragraph structure. It has been reprinted a number of times and translated into many languages and is one of the most widely read Spanish texts in the 20th century. This edition is aimed primarily at sixth-formers and university undergraduates and the introduction and notes have been compiled in the light of recent socio-politial topic-based syllabuses and communication studies courses. The inclusion in the introduction of a substantial section on the now out-of-print &#34;Contraataque&#34; (1937), the wartime narrative which contains the germ of the post-war novel, is intended to provide the student with a context for the study of the process in Sender&#39;s writing inspired by the Civil War - from explicit militant propaganda penned in the heat of battle to implicit poetic parable, historical emotion recollected in the comparative tranquillity and distance of exile. It is hoped that such a juxtaposition will illuminate both the content and literary achievement of &#34;Requiem&#34;.</p><p>Ram�n J.

Only David Foster Wallace could convey a father's desperate loneliness by way of his son's daydreaming through a teacher's homicidal breakdown ("The Soul Is Not a Smithy"). Or could explore the deepest and most hilarious aspects of creativity by delineating the office politics surrounding a magazine profile of an artist who produces miniature sculptures in an anatomically inconceivable way ("The Suffering Channel"). Or capture the ache of love's breakdown in the painfully polite apologies of a man who believes his wife is hallucinating the sound of his snoring ("Oblivion"). <br>Each of these stories is a complete world, as fully imagined as most entire novels, at once preposterously surreal and painfully immediate.</p><p>David Foster Wallace was born in Ithaca, New York, in 1962 and raised in Illinois, where he was a regionally ranked junior tennis player. He received bachelor of arts degrees in philosophy and English from Amherst College and wrote what would become his first novel, <em>The Broom of the System</em>, as his senior English thesis. He received a masters of fine arts from University of Arizona in 1987 and briefly pursued graduate work in philosophy at Harvard University. His second novel,<em> Infinite Jest</em>, was published in 1996. Wallace taught creative writing at Emerson College, Illinois State University, and Pomona College, and published the story collections <em>Girl with Curious Hair</em>, <em>Brief Interviews with Hideous Men</em>, <em>Oblivion, </em>the essay collections <em>A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again,</em> and <em>Consider the Lobster</em>. He was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship, a Lannan Literary Award, and a Whiting Writers' Award, and was appointed to the Usage Panel for The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. He died in 2008. His last novel, <em>The Pale King</em>, was published in 2011.In his best work, <i>Infinite Jest</i>, Wallace leavened his smartest-boy-in-class style, perfected in his essays and short stories, with a stereoscopic reproduction of other voices. Wallace's trademark, however, is an officious specificity, typical of the Grade A student overreaching: shifting levels of microscopic detail and self-reflection. This collection of eight stories highlights both the power and the weakness of these idiosyncrasies. The best story in the book, "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature," assembles a typical Wallaceian absurdity: a paroled, autodidactic arachnophile accompanies his mother, the victim of plastic surgery malpractice ("the cosmetic surgeon botched it and did something to the musculature of her face which caused her to look insanely frightened at all times"), on a bus ride to a lawyer's office. "The Suffering Channel" moves from the grotesque to the gross-out, as a journalist for <i>Style</i> (a celebrity magazine) pursues a story about a man whose excrement comes out as sculpture. The title story, about a man and wife driven to visit a sleep clinic, is narrated by the husband, who soon reveals himself to be the tedious idiot his father-in-law takes him for. While this collection may please Wallace's most rabid fans, others will be disappointed that a writer of so much talent seems content, this time around, to retreat into a set of his most overused stylistic quirks. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While temples were destroyed on a considerable scale, also noteworthy were the repeated endeavours to reconstruct them. In each instance of rebirth, the temple retained its original name, even though there was a visible downsizing in its scale and grandeur. The Keshava temple at Mathura, the Vishwanath temple at Kashi, the Somnath temple in Saurashtra, the Rama mandir at Ayodhya were among the shrines continually restored, well after Hindus had lost all semblance of political power. The Bindu Madhava, the most important Vishnu temple in Varanasi, was demolished in 1669 and a mosque constructed in its place. The temple now bearing the name Bindu Madhava is a modest structure in the shadow of the mosque, but continues the traditions associated with the site. Intriguingly, mosques built on temple sites often retained the sacred names - Bijamandal mosque, Lat masjid, Atala masjid, Gyanvapi mosque, and not to forget, masjid-i- janamsthan.<br><br>Equally worthy of study was the fate of images enshrined in temples. Many were swiftly removed by anxious devotees, many more were hurriedly buried; some remained on the move for decades, till such time they could be escorted back to their abodes. In several cases, images were damaged in flight. Countless images were lost, as their places of burial were forgotten over time. That necessitated the consecration of new images in more peaceable circumstances. So there were temples of the tenth-eleventh centuries, which housed images instated in the sixteenth. In situations where neither temple nor image could be safeguarded, the memory endured, and a shrine was recreated after an interval of several centuries.<br></p><p></p><h2>Greenlanders</h2><p>"HAUNTING."<br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>Jane Smiley, the Pultizer Prize-winning author of A Thousand Acres, gives us a magnificent novel of fourteenth-century Greenland.

His homefield was nearly as large as the homefield at Gardar, where the absent bishop had his seat, and he had another large field as well. From the time he took over the farm upon the death of his father, this Asgeir had a great reputation among the Greenlanders for pride. It happened that when he was a young man he went off on the king&#39;s knarr to Norway, and when he returned to Gunnars Stead two years later, he brought with him an Icelandic wife, whose name was Helga Ingvadottir. She carried with her two wallhangings and six white ewes with black faces, as well as other valuable goods, and for pride folk said that Asgeir was well matched in her.Asgeir built a special pen for these Icelandic ewes at the edge of his second field, and this pen was visible from the steading. Each morning Asgeir liked to open the door of the steading and gaze out upon his ewes cropping the rich grass of his second field, and when Helga brought him his bowl of sourmilk, he would turn and set his eyes upon her elaborate headdress and the silver brooches that lay against her throat. Thus he would contemplate his luck. About this time, Helga Ingvadottir gave birth to a child who was named Margret, and who was a sturdy, quiet child and a great source of pride to the mother.Also visible from the door of the steading was the turf hut belonging to Thorunn Jorundsdottir, and the bit of land surrounding this hut cut a notch in the Gunnars Stead property where it met the property of Ketil Erlendsson, Asgeir&#39;s nearest neighbor. This Thorunn was an old woman, who kept one cow and only a few sheep and goats. She supplemented her meager provisions by going about to nearby farms and begging for some of this and some of that. She was also given much to whispering, and folk in the district were not disinclined to hear what she had to say, although they were disinclined to speak of it.There was nothing about this Thorunn that Helga Ingvadottir cared for, neither her whispering, nor her begging, nor the sight of her hovel on the horizon, nor the way that the one cow and the few sheep and goats often strayed among Gunnars Stead beasts. One day Thorunn came to Gunnars Stead, as she was in the habit of doing, and asked Helga for some of the new milk. Helga, who was standing in the doorway of the dairy, with basins of new milk all about her, refused this request, for recently she had felt another child quicken within her, and it was well known among the Greenlanders that a woman hoping for a boy child must drink only new milk. Thorunn glanced about at the basins of milk and went away muttering. Later, when Asgeir returned to the steading for his evening meat, Helga spoke bitterly against the old woman, until Asgeir demanded silence.But it seemed the case that Thorunn had indeed cursed the Gunnars Stead folk, for not long after this, one of Asgeir&#39;s horses stepped in a hole and broke his leg, and had to have his throat cut, and then, after the servants had filled in the hole, another of the horses stepped in the same hole, and broke the selfsame leg, and had to have his throat cut, as well. And then Helga Ingvadottir came to her time, but the birth did not go well, and though the child lived, the mother did not. This was in the year 1352, by the reckoning of the stick calendar at Gardar.Asgeir named the child Gunnar, for there had been a Gunnar or an Asgeir at Gunnars Stead since the time of Erik the Red, when Erik gave his friend Hafgrim all of Austfjord and the northern part of Vatna Hverfi district, the richest district in all of Greenland, and Hafgrim gave a piece to the first Gunnar, his cousin. The child Gunnar was not especially small and not especially large. His nurse was a servingwoman whose name was Ingrid. Margret was by this time some seven winters old.The child Gunnar did not grow well, and when he should have been walking, he was only sitting up, and when he should have been playing with the other children about the farmstead, Margret was still carrying him about in a sling upon her back. Asgeir regretted naming the child Gunnar, and spoke of changing it to Ingvi.Asgeir Gunnarsson had a brother who also lived at Gunnars Stead, who was named Hauk. Hauk had no wife, and was very fond of all sorts of hunting and snaring and fishing. He had been to the Northsetur, far to the north of the western settlement, where Greenlanders liked to hunt walrus and narwhal and polar bear, such large animals as were very valuable to the bishop and to the ships that came from the archbishop of Nidaros and the king in Norway. He sought the icy, waste districts both summer and winter, and his skills made Gunnars Stead especially prosperous. He spoke little. Asgeir said his brother could make the killing of a polar bear sound like a day at the butter churn. Hauk was the taller of the two brothers, very straight-limbed and fair-looking. Asgeir often urged him to find himself a wife, but Hauk said nothing to these suggestions, as he said nothing to most suggestions. He was well liked among the Greenlanders for his skills, and not blamed for his independent ways, for the Greenlanders live far out on the western ocean, and know what it is to depend upon themselves in all things.One day Asgeir gathered together a group of men. Toward dusk, they surrounded Thorunn&#39;s little steading and called her out. When she came, carrying a basin and muttering in her usual fashion, Asgeir said that he was tired of her curses, and he killed her with his sheep-shearing knife. Gunnar was three winters old. Now he began to walk and to act more like other children. Asgeir stopped talking of changing his name to lngvi. Folk in the district said little of this killing. Thorunn had a niece with a young daughter who lived in Petursvik at Ketils Fjord, far to the south, but no male relatives to exact revenge. It was clear enough that she had put a spell over the child, and many praised Asgeir for his decisive action, including especially Hauk Gunnarsson, who had been away in Isafjord and not present at the killing. After Thorunn was buried near Undir Hofdi church, Asgeir sent his servants to her steading and had them tear it down, and he gave the cow and the sheep to Nikolaus, the priest at Undir Hofdi church, along with all of Thorunn&#39;s house furnishings. In this way, the boundary between Gunnars Stead and Ketils Stead was straightened, and the unsightly steading could no longer be seen from the doorway at Gunnars Stead. After these events, it seemed to Asgeir that he had renewed his good luck, and he was much pleased with himself.It was Margret&#39;s habit and pleasure as a child to walk about in the hills above the farmstead looking for herbs and bilberries, and most of the time she would carry Gunnar with her in a sling, for at eleven winters of age she was tall and strong, taller than Ingrid by far and not so much shorter than Asgeir himself. It happened on one such day a year after the killing of Thorunn the witch that Margret strayed beyond her usual range, and Gunnar, tired from playing among the tiny, trickling streams and tangles of birch scrub, fell into a deep sleep. It was well past the time for evening meat when Margret carried the sleeping child back to the farmstead, and she looked for a beating from Ingrid, but instead she found the farmstead deserted and everything quiet.The nurse Ingrid was a great storyteller, and she had told Margret many stories of the skraelings and their evil ways, and of the sad lives of little girls whom the skraelings stole and took with them into the north, farther north than the Northsetur, where Hauk Gunnarsson hunted for walrus and narwhal. Now Margret sat with her back against the turf of the steading and contemplated how the babies of these little girls would never be baptized, and would be taken out in the dark of winter and left to the elements. These little girls would be beaten if they dared to pray, and would have to submit to any man who wanted them. They would never bathe from year to year, and would wear only animal skins, and when they died they would have no final sacraments, and so they would spend eternal life in the same darkness and cold, and with the same sort of devilish companions as the skraelings. The fact was, that it was not unusual for Margret to give herself over to thoughts such as these, for though they frightened her, they also drew her. It made no difference that Asgeir laughed at Ingrid&#39;s tales, and declared that she had never seen a skraeling in her life (for the skraelings did not come near the Norse farms and never had), nor that Hauk Gunnarsson himself had frequent intercourse with the demons, and admired their hunting skills and the warmth of their garments. On the other hand, Margret had heard Asgeir and Ivar Bardarson, the priest who had Gardar in his charge until the coming of the new bishop, speaking of what had befallen the western settlement, for Ivar Bardarson had taken some men and gone there in a boat and found all of the farms abandoned and all of the livestock dead or scattered to the wastelands. And she had heard them mention skraelings more than once. She got up, ostensibly to find Gunnar some bits of dried fish and butter, for he was whimpering with hunger, but really to look around the corners of the steading. There was no one, man nor demon, to be seen. Dusk was falling. She sat down and took Gunnar upon her lap. He began to eat, and she dozed off.The two children were awakened by the glare of torches and the sound of Asgeir&#39;s rolling voice. &#34;Well,&#34; he said, &#34;here are the only folk along the whole of Einars Fjord who know nothing of the great event.&#34; He smiled in the flickering light of the torches. &#34;A ship has come, my daughter, and though it brings no bishop, we will not send it back for one without unloading it first.&#34;Now folk crowded into the steading, not only Gunnars Stead folk, but Ketils Stead folk, too, for this event was interesting enough to draw the whole neighborhood together for talk and speculation. Gunnar sat open-eyed at the bench while Margret, Ingrid, and the servingmaids dished up sourmilk and other refreshments for the guests. Ketil Erlendsson spoke up. &#34;Even so, it is but a single ship, and not sent of the king, either.&#34;&#34;Nor of the bishop,&#34; said one of the other men.Asgeir said, &#34;But it is large enough for there to be a bit of something for each of us.&#34; He laughed. &#34;Something, it is certain, that we did not know we needed before this.&#34;Now a man spoke whom Gunnar had never seen before, dark and sour-looking, with odd, crinkly hair. &#34;The news is that King Magnus has given the throne to King Hakon now, though Magnus still lives.&#34; He spoke angrily, and Gunnar&#39;s cousin, Thorkel, said with a grin, &#34;Erlend Ketilsson, you sound as if he might have given the throne to you, had events gone another way.&#34; Gunnar had heard the name of the man, Erlend Ketilsson, many times, and widened his eyes in the flickering light to get a good look at him. His gaze seemed to fall upon Erlend like the touch of a hand, for the young man turned at once and stared back. Now Gunnar raised his palms to his face and pulled his cheeks down, until his eyes were staring out of the sockets, then he thrust forth his tongue, nearly to the roots. It was the work of a moment. Thorkel saw him and laughed aloud. Erlend scowled. Ketil said, &#34;That won&#39;t be the only news, you may be sure, and the rest of it will be worse.&#34;&#34;Few goods and bad news,&#34; said Asgeir, &#34;but I am content. That is enough for me, if there is nothing else.&#34; The other men nodded and ate up the sourmilk and went off.The next day, all the Greenlanders flocked to Gardar to catch sight of the Norwegians and to trade the goods they had been hoarding for many years. The captain of the traders, a Bergen man named Thorleif, seemed to laugh all the time. He roared with laughter at the sight of the Greenlanders&#39; tradegoods: sealskins and walrus tusks and lengths of homespun fabric, piles of sheepskins and reindeer skins and long twisted narwhal tusks. He came near to folk and peered at them, then laughed. The sailors seemed too sober by comparison, and hardly had a word to say. They stared at the Greenlanders, in fact, and stood like dolts around the Gardar field, as if they had never seen a cathedral, or a byre, or a hall such as the great Gardar hall, or sheep and goats and cattle grazing about the hillsides, or horses in their pens, or the landing spot, or the fjord itself, or the high dark mountains that rose all about. When Ivar Bardarson brought out cheese and sourmilk and boiled reindeer meat and dried sealmeat--a feast, in the view of most of the Greenlanders--they gazed at that for a long time before they began to eat it.Asgeir said to Thorleif, &#34;Are your men such farmboys that they&#39;ve never seen wealth like this before?&#34; and Gunnar thought Thorleif would choke from laughing at this joke.&#34;Nay, Greenlander,&#34; he finally replied. &#34;It is only what they have heard about this place. Some folk say that all Greenlanders are a little bluish, which is why you are called Greenlanders. And other folk say that you live on a diet of ice and salt water, and such a diet sustains you through your being accustomed to it.&#34;Now Asgeir grinned a wide grin, and said, &#34;These things may be true of Herjolfsnes men, for they live far to the south and keep to themselves. You will have to see for yourself.&#34;&#34;Perhaps I will. Our voyage was not so short that I can return this summer, as I had hoped.&#34; Thorleif looked about and laughed again. Asgeir said, &#34;Most folk do not laugh at the prospect of a Greenland winter.&#34;</p><h2>The Consumer&#39;s Guide to Homeopathy</h2><p>A complete guide to homeopathic medicine details the principles of this powerful healing approach, explaining how to use trigger the body&#39;s own self-healing abilities, discussing remedies, dosages, and a wide range of treatment options. Original.</p><p>Dana, Ullman, M.P.H., is the director of Homeopathic Educational Services in Berkeley, California.Relatively speaking, homeopathy is one of the more recent developments in alternative health care. It is based upon a controversial theory of "similars" developed in the 18th century by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann. Hahnemann believed that by administering highly diluted tinctures derived from herbs, minerals, and other ingredients, the body would heal itself of diseases that had symptoms similar to those caused by the medicines. The Consumer's Guide to Homeopathy, written by the author of Homeopathic Medicine for Children and Infants (LJ 7/92) and other books on the subject, is a comprehensive study of homeopathy. The emphasis here is on research, with much of the book given to discussions of scientific studies and professional procedures, including a detailed appendix of homeopathic resources, books, software, organizations, etc. Although there is information on the use of homeopathic medicines in the treatment of specific conditions, the book's format is geared toward consumer education. It answers the most common questions asked about homeopathic medicine, including myths and misconceptions, describes what to look for when choosing a homeopathic physician, and provides readers with information necessary to make intelligent choices about their treatment. Conversely, Hammond's The Complete Family Guide to Homeopathy is a richly illustrated, visually stunning encyclopedia in the DK style. The information is presented in a very accessible way, perfect for anyone interested in trying the medications for themselves. The emphasis here is on home treatment, with fully half of the book dedicated to pictorial descriptions of the remedies used, as well as 100 pages of symptoms charts used to determine which remedies may be most beneficial. For those readers interested in a do-it-yourself guide or for libraries looking for a one-volume purchase on homeopathy, Hammond's book is a must. Ullman's title, though also recommended, may better serve larger or more specialized collections.?Jeffery Ingram, Newport P.L., Ore.<br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>ROAST CHICKEN AND OTHER STORIES</h2><p><i>'There's not a recipe here I don't want to eat immediately.' - <b>Nigella Lawson</b></i><br><i></i><br><i>Roast Chicken and Other Stories </i>provides an insight into Simon Hopkinson's unique style of unpretentious cooking with 160 of his favourite recipes. Simon Hopkinson's forty favourite ingredients include everyday basics as potatoes, chicken and cod as well as more exotic foods such as asparagus and truffles. The cookbook is arranged alphabetically with a chapter on each food. Unable to hide his great love of food, Hopkinson writes about why he likes each particular ingredient, and gives sensible advice on quality, variety and good cooking principles together with the recipes. The book is aimed at home cooks and all the recipes can be prepared by anyone with basic cooking skills. From Grilled Augergine with Pesto to Roast Chicken and Homemade Ice Cream, Simon Hopkinson's food is always honest and inviting, designed to please rather than simply to impress.</p><p><strong>Simon Hopkinson</strong> was born and raised in Lancashire. From his first restaurant job at age 17, La Normandie restaurant, where he worked under the tutelage of Yves Champeau, he then moved to London to set up Bibendum (right) in Kensington with Sir Terence Conran, which he left to pursue his food writing. He has written an award-winning column for <em>The Independent</em> since 1995. He lives in London.This idiosyncratic though charming cookbook was first published in the U.K. in 1994 and became a runaway favorite with a second publication in 2006. Hopkinson, a founding chef of London's Bibendum and a newspaper columnist, rejects the notion that a dinner's merit should be judged by its number of ingredients or steps. Instead, his earthy sensibility is guided by French techniques, rich English ingredients and lots and lots of butter. Chapters are organized not by course but by Hopkinson's favorite ingredients, such as eggplant (grilled, creamed, baked and stewed in his cayenne-spiked version of the Turkish classic Imam Bayildi); leeks (in vinaigrette, in a tart crust, vichyssoise, baked with cream and mint); and tripe (Madrid-style, Lyonnaise style, deep-fried). Each chapter begins with a bit of history and often witty personal reminiscence. He'll chart the use of anchovies around the globe, quote fellow food writer Elizabeth David on the beauty of <i>ancho�ade</i> and guide readers to the best canned variety in the market. The recipes themselves are designed for the intuitive cook who can gauge a dish's doneness by its color rather than by slavish devotion to a timer. Yet Hopkinson's recipes are true winners, inspiring confidence in the kitchen and pleasure at the table with their simple, satisfying flavors. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Excited, she opened the window, but the sash stuck midway and she had to pound it the rest of the way with the palm of her hand. It finally opened to a rush of sharp early November air that would have the town in a flurry of activity, anticipating the tourists the colder weather always brought to the high mountains of North Carolina.<br><br> She stuck her head out and took a deep breath. If she could eat the cold air, she would. She thought cold snaps were like cookies, like gingersnaps. In her mind they were made with white chocolate chunks and had a cool, brittle vanilla frosting. They melted like snow in her mouth, turning creamy and warm.<br><br> Just before she ducked her head back inside, she looked down and noticed something strange.<br><br> There was a ladder propped against the house, directly underneath her window.<br><br> She leaned back in quickly and closed her window. She paused, then she locked it.<br><br> She turned and walked to her closet, distracted now. She hadn't heard anything strange last night. The tree trimmers from yesterday must have left the ladder. Yes. That had to be it. They'd probably propped it against the house and then completely forgotten about it.<br><br> She opened her closet door and reached up to pull the string that turned on the light.<br><br> Then she screamed and backed away, stopping only when she hit her desk and her lamp crashed to the floor.<br><br> "Oh for God's sake," the woman sitting on the floor of her closet said, "don't have a cow."<br><br> "Josey?" She heard her mother's voice in the hall, then the thud of her cane as she came closer.<br><br> "Please don't tell her I'm here," the woman in the closet said, with a strange sort of desperation. Despite the cold outside, she was wearing a cropped white shirt and tight dark blue jeans that sat low, revealing a tattoo of a broken heart on her hip. Her hair was bleached white-blond with about an inch of silver-sprinkled dark roots showing. Her mascara had run and there were black streaks on her cheeks. She looked drip-dried, like she'd been walking in the rain, though there hadn't been rain for days. She smelled like cigarette smoke and river water.<br><br> Josey turned her head as her bedroom door began to open. Then, in a small act that changed everything, Josey reached over and pushed the closet door closed as her mother entered the room.<br><br> "Josey? What was that noise? Are you all right?" Margaret asked. She'd been a beautiful woman in her day, delicate and trim, blue-eyed and fair-haired. There was a certain power beautiful mothers held over their less beautiful daughters. Even at seventy-four, with a limp from a hip replacement, Margaret could still enter a room and fill it like perfume. Josey could never do that. The closest she ever came was the attention she used to receive when she pitched legendary fits in public when she was young. But that was making people look at her for all the wrong reasons.<br><br> "My lamp," Josey said. "It attacked me out of nowhere."<br><br> "Oh, well," Margaret said distantly, "leave it for the maid to clean. Hurry up and get dressed. My doctor's appointment is at nine."<br><br> "Yes, Mother."<br><br> Margaret closed the bedroom door. Josey waited until the clump of her cane faded away before she rushed to the closet door and opened it again.<br><br> Most locals knew who Della Lee was. She waitressed at a greasy spoon called Eat and Run, which was tucked far enough outside the town limits that the ski-crowd tourists didn't see it. She haunted bars at night. She was probably in her late thirties, maybe ten years older than Josey, and she was rough and flashy and did whatever she wanted&#x2014;no reasonable explanation required.<br><br> "Della Lee Baker, what are you doing in my closet?"<br><br> "You shouldn't leave your window unlocked. Who knows who could get in?" Della Lee said, single-handedly debunking the long-held belief that if you dotted your windowsills and door thresholds with peppermint oil, no unwanted visitors would ever appear. For years Josey's mother had instructed every maid in their employ to anoint the house's casings with peppermint to keep the undesirables away. Their house now smelled like the winter holidays all year round.<br><br> Josey took a step back and pointed. "Get out."<br><br> "I can't."<br><br> "You most certainly can."<br><br> "I need a place to hide."<br><br> "I see. And of course this was the first place you thought of."<br><br> "Who would look for me here?"<br><br> Rough women had rough ways. Was Della Lee trying to tell her that she was in danger? "Okay, I'll bite. Who's looking for you, Della Lee?"<br><br> "Maybe no one. Maybe they haven't discovered I'm missing yet." Then, to Josey's surprise, Della Lee reached over to the false wall at the back of the narrow closet and slid it open. "And speaking of discoveries, look what I found."<br><br> Revealed now was the large secret space behind the closet. There were stacks of paperback romances, magazines and catalogs on the floor, but most of the secret closet was occupied by shelves piled with food&#x2014;packaged snacks, rows of sweets, towers of colas.<br><br> Josey's entire body suddenly burned with panic. She was supposed to be happy. And most of the time she supposed she was, in an awkward, sleepy kind of way. She'd never be the beauty her mother was, or have the personality of her late father. She was pale and plain and just this side of plump, and she accepted that. But food was a comfort. It filled in the hollow spaces. And it felt good to hide it, because then she could enjoy it alone without worrying about what others thought, or about letting her mother down.<br><br> "I need to figure some things out first," Della Lee said, sliding the door back in place, her point made. She was letting Josey know that she knew her secret.&nbsp;<i>Don't reveal mine and I won't reveal yours.</i>&nbsp;"Then I'll be moving up north."<br><br> "You can't stay here. I'll give you some money. You can stay in a motel." Josey started to turn, to get her wallet, to get Della Lee away from her food. But then she stopped. "Wait. You're leaving Bald Slope?"<br><br> "Like you don't dream of leaving this stupid town," Della Lee said, leaning back on her hands.<br><br> "Don't be ridiculous. I'm a Cirrini."<br><br> "Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't those travel magazines in your secret closet?"<br><br> Josey bristled. She pointed again. "Get&nbsp;<i>out</i>."<br><br> "It looks like I got here just in time. This is not the closet of a happy woman, Josey."<br><br> "At least I'm not hiding in it."<br><br> "I bet you do sometimes."<br><br> "Get out."<br><br> "No."<br><br> "That's it. I'm calling the police."<br><br> Della Lee laughed. She actually sat there and laughed at Josey. Her front teeth were a little crooked, but it looked good on her, offbeat and sassy. She was the kind of woman who could get away with anything because she had no boundaries. "And what will you say? There's a woman in your closet, come get her out? They might find your stash."<br><br> Josey thought about calling Della Lee's bluff. It would serve her right. It might even be worth everyone knowing about the food in her closet. But then her heart began to beat harder. Who was she kidding? It was embarrassing enough being such a sorry excuse for a Southern belle. Her weight, her unfortunate hair, her secret dreams of leaving her mother who needed her, of leaving and never looking back. Respectable daughters took care of their mothers. Respectable daughters did not hide enormous amounts of candy in their closets.<br><br> "So you stay, you don't tell anyone, is that it?"<br><br> "Sure," Della Lee said easily.<br><br> "That's blackmail."<br><br> "Add it to my list of sins."<br><br> "I don't think there's room left on that list," Josey said as she took a dress from its hanger. Then she closed the closet door on Della Lee.<br><br> She went to the bathroom down the hall to dress and to pull her very curly, licorice-black hair back into a low ponytail. When she walked back to her bedroom, she stared at her closet door for a moment. It looked completely innocuous. The door and its casing were painted an antique white set against the pale blue of the room. The corner blocks at the top of the casing were hand-carved in a circular bull's-eye pattern. The doorknob was white porcelain, shaped like a mushroom cap.<br><br> She took a deep breath and walked to it. Maybe she'd imagined the whole thing.<br><br> She opened the door.<br><br> "You should wear makeup," Della Lee said.<br><br> Josey reached up and grabbed her lucky red cardigan off the high shelf, then closed the door. She put the sweater on and closed her eyes.&nbsp;<i>Go away, go away, go away</i>.<br><br> She opened the door again.<br><br> "No, really. Mascara. Lip gloss. Something."</p><h2>Introducing Christian Mission Today: Scripture, History, and Issues</h2><p><ul><li>2014 Best Texts of Missiology, from Byron Borger, Hearts and Minds Bookstore</li></ul> Mission--a driving force in the long Christian story--today is often cast as the embarrassing relative of tall-steeple religiosity. In our wider culture it's now tucked in the endnotes of book-club histories or forms the ghostlike ellipses in the six o'clock news. But in <em>Introducing Christian Mission Today</em>, Michael Goheen brings the vibrant history, motivation and challenges of Christian mission to the fore. Through the centuries Christian mission has always been recalibrating, retooling and reevangelizing. It has repeatedly taken surprising turns as it is carried along by the Spirit of God. Goheen's introduction to mission's biblical, theological and historical dimensions engages the present and anticipates the future. As he unfolds the major issues of the global and urban, the pluralistic and wholistic contexts of mission today, he lays the ground for engaging in God?s great kingdom enterprise. This full-scale text incorporates the keen missional insights of Lesslie Newbigin, David Bosch and other formative thinkers. It will be a valued resource not only for those in crosscultural contexts but also for those engaged in reevangelizing the West.</p><p>Michael W. Goheen (PhD, University of Utrecht) is theological director and scholar-in-residence in missional theology at the Missional Training Center in Phoenix. He is also professor of missional theology at Newbigin House of Studies and Jake and Betsy Tuls Professor of Missiology at Calvin Theological Seminary. His published works include <em>A Light to the Nations</em> and <em>The Drama of Scripture</em> (coauthored with Craig Bartholomew)."Michael W. Goheen has produced here more than an introduction to mission studies. In this volume of some four hundred pages he provides a comprehensive, scholarly survey of the biblical, historical and contemporary issues in world mission that will serve to inform a generation of students and pastors. It is a remarkable achievement." (Gerald H. Anderson, director emeritus, Overseas Ministries Study Center)<br><br>"This is an outstanding and needed book. Michael Goheen gives us a distinctive introduction to mission study that takes full account of both the momentous changes happening in global Christianity and recent thinking about the missional nature of the church. Rich in its biblical and theological grasp of mission, the book addresses precisely the right issues confronting the mission of God's people today. This introductory text is accessible, balanced and, at times, profoundly moving. Readers beware! This book will reshape your thinking about the nature and practice of Christian mission." (Dean Flemming, professor of New Testament and missions, MidAmerica Nazarene University)<br><br>"Very few people can combine multiple areas of expertise in their own thinking, let alone in a single book. Mike Goheen is one of those few. This wide-ranging survey is the fruit of a true teacher's passion for the whole scope of his discipline. We are led steadily to understand mission from its biblical foundations, in theological reflection, through millenia of historical practice, across multiple cultural and ecclesial contexts, to the most urgent issues facing the church in mission today and tomorrow. Theologically enriching, reliably informative, and both conceptually and practically challenging." (Christopher J. H. Wright, international ministries director, Langham Partnership)<br><br>"Based on Scripture and in light of current and historical developments, <em>Introducing Christian Mission Today </em>recalibrates the church's understanding of mission. Evangelical in spirit, yet ecumenical in breadth, this is an important and stimulating introduction to the foundations, challenges and issues of Christian mission today." (Craig Ott, professor of mission and intercultural studies at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"<em>Introducing Christian Mission Today</em> is a well-written, accessible and comprehensive survey of mission theology. Michael Goheen provides the reader with an authoritative and balanced account of the salient developments--starting with a robust biblical theology that puts the mission of God at the dynamic center--that have transformed our understanding over the past century. This work edifies and challenges." (Wilbert R. Shenk, senior professor of mission history and contemporary culture, Fuller Graduate School of Intercultural Studies)<br><br>"Michael Goheen has distilled some of the best of recent Western missiological thinking into a readable and well-organized presentation. The book is current and has God's entire, comprehensive and worldwide mission in view. There are also particular examples and focused discussions on such crucial topics as urban mission. Many congregations, individuals and mission agencies will find great insight and reap much benefit here." (J. Nelson Jennings, executive director, Overseas Ministries Study Center)<br><br>"An excellent resource for mission agencies as a well-written introduction on the missional nature of the Church, with focused exploration of the developments that have contributed to transformed understandings of mission over the last century." (Allison Norton, Evangelical Missions Quarterly, July 2015)<br><br>"Goheen argues compellingly that we have much to learn from the global church." (Nick Smith, Christian Renewal, July 29, 2015)<br><br>"Michael Goheen's book will be added to my list of recommended books. Part one gives a biblical and theological reflection on mission. Part two hands the reader a historical and contemporary reflection on mission. These chapters are more than mere reflections; they also contain gospel-centered recommendations to move the worldwide church forward. . . . This book gives the church guidance and hope to continually be involved in God's mission."

But where would he get the money? He did not know. Still, he hoped.<br></i><br>Eleven-year-old Chike longs to cross the Niger River to the city of Asaba, but he doesn&#x2019;t have the sixpence he needs to pay for the ferry ride. With the help of his friend S.M.O.G., he embarks on a series of adventures to help him get there. Along the way, he is exposed to a range of new experiences that are both thrilling and terrifying, from eating his first skewer of <i>suya</i> under the shade of a mango tree, to visiting the village magician who promises to double the money in his pocket. Once he finally makes it across the river, Chike realizes that life on the other side is far different from his expectations, and he must find the courage within him to make it home. <br><br><i>Chike and the River </i>is a magical tale of boundaries, bravery, and growth, by Chinua Achebe, one of the world&#x2019;s most beloved and admired storytellers.</p></p><p><p><b>Chinua Achebe&nbsp;</b>(1930&#x2013;2013)<b>&nbsp;</b>was born in Nigeria. Widely considered to be the father of modern African literature, he is best known for his masterful African Trilogy, consisting of&nbsp;<i>Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God</i>, and&nbsp;<i>No Longer at Ease</i>.

In 2007, Achebe was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement.&nbsp;<br><br></p>1<br><br>Chike Leaves His Village<br><br>Chike lived with his mother and two sisters in the village of Umuofia. His father had died many years ago. His mother worked very hard to feed and clothe her three children and to send them to school. She grew most of the food they ate-yams, cassava, maize, beans, plantains, and many green vegetables. She also traded in dry fish, palm oil, kerosene, and matches.<br><br>Chike was now eleven years old, and he had never left his village. Then one day his mother told him that he would be going to Onitsha in the new year to live with his uncle who was a clerk in one of the firms there. At first Chike was full of joy. He was tired of living in a bush village and wanted to see a big city. He had heard many wonderful stories about Onitsha. His uncle's servant, Michael, had told him that there was a water tap in the very compound where they lived. Chike said this was impossible but Michael had sworn to its truth by wetting his first finger on his tongue and pointing it to the sky. Chike was too thrilled for words. So he would no longer wake up early in the morning to go to the stream. The trouble with their village stream was that the way to it was very rough and stony, and sometimes children fell and broke their water-pots. In Onitsha Chike would be free from all those worries. Also he would live in a house with an iron roof instead of his mother's poor hut of mud and thatch. It all sounded so wonderful.<br><br>But when the time actually came for Chike to leave his mother and sisters he began to cry. His sisters cried too, and even his mother had signs of tears in her eyes. She placed one hand on his head and said, "Go well, my son. Listen to whatever your uncle says and obey him. Onitsha is a big city, full of dangerous people and kidnappers. Therefore do not wander about the city. In particular do not go near the River Niger; many people get drowned there every year . . ."<br><br>She gave Chike many other words of advice. He nodded his head and sniffed because his nose was running. Chike's nose always ran when he cried.<br><br>"Stop crying," said his mother. "Remember, you are now a big boy, and big boys don't cry."<br><br>Chike wiped his eyes with the back of his hand. Then he took up his small wooden box which his mother had bought from James Okeke, the local carpenter. Inside it were his few clothes and schoolbooks.<br><br>"Let us go," said his uncle who had been waiting patiently. "If we don't hurry now, we shall miss the lorry."*<br><br>Chike set the box on his head and followed his uncle. They were going to the main road half a mile away to take the lorry that passed by their village<br><br>to Onitsha. It was a very old lorry called Slow-<br><br>and-Steady. It always had great difficulty going up any hill. Whenever it got to a steep hill the driver's mate would jump down and walk behind it with the big wooden wedge. Sometimes the passengers were asked to climb down and help push the lorry. The forty-mile journey to Onitsha took Slow-and-Steady more than three hours. Sometimes it broke down completely; then the journey might take a whole day or more.<br><br>Chike was, however, lucky on the day he made the journey. Slow-and- Steady was in good form and did not break down at all. It only stopped after every hill to take a tin of water.</p><h2>Read This if You Want to Take Great Photographs of Places: (Beginners Guide, Landscape photography, Street photography)</h2><p>From the author of the bestselling <em>Read This If You Want To Take Great Photographs</em> series, this jargon-free introduction covers all aspects of photographing places, including landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, and interiors. <br><br>Whatever your camera, whatever your interest, whatever your level, this indispensible guide gives you all the essential techniques and demystifies the work of acclaimed photographers.

Then, in 2005, astronomer Mike Brown made the discovery of a lifetime: a tenth planet, Eris, slightly bigger than Pluto. But instead of adding one more planet to our solar system, Brown&#x2019;s find ignited a firestorm of controversy that culminated in the demotion of Pluto from real planet to the newly coined category of &#x201c;dwarf&#x201d; planet. Suddenly Brown was receiving hate mail from schoolchildren and being bombarded by TV reporters&#x2014;all because of the discovery he had spent years searching for and a lifetime dreaming about.<br><br>A heartfelt and personal journey filled with both humor and drama, <i>How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming</i> is the book for anyone, young or old, who has ever imagined exploring the universe&#x2014;and who among us hasn&#x2019;t?</p></p><p><b>A Letter from Author Mike Brown</b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> My daughter Lilah, now five years old, is mad at me for killing Pluto. When I began a project 13 years ago to chart the slowly-moving objects of the distant outer solar system, my goal was never to pull Pluto off of its cherished planetary pedestal. I wanted to be a planet discoverer, like William Herschel or Clyde Tombaugh before me. I had a strong feeling that somewhere out there something bigger than Pluto was lurking, and I knew that whoever found it would get to claim the mantle as the only living planet discoverer. <p></p> I was right. Something bigger than Pluto <i>was</i> out there (or at least something more massive than Pluto; sizes are a little harder to pin down precisely) and one January morning in 2005, my small team of astronomers and I found it. We announced the discovery of the 10th planet to an unsuspecting world late on the afternoon of Lilah&#x2019;s 22nd day of life. A little after her first birthday, though, the doors to the planetary club were locked and Pluto and my own discovery were kicked out on the curb. The solar system was down to only eight planets. <p></p> It was hard not to mourn the loss of my now ex-planet, except for the fact that I had to admit that kicking it out was the most scientifically sensible thing to happen to planetary classification since asteroids were also kicked out almost 200 years ago. The solar system is a beautiful and profound place, and it is made <i>richer</i> with the realization that the eight planets are the foundation throughout which countless smaller bodies continuously swirl. <p></p> When Pluto was first demoted, people said to me, &#x201c;What about the children? How could you do this to them?&#x201d; But, in fact, children live lives that are always changing. It&#x2019;s the adults who have had the hardest time reconciling the new understanding of the solar system with what they remember from when they themselves were children. So, it made sense that I used to joke about what would happen the moment when Lilah first learned about the solar system. She would come home, and I would say, &#x201c;Tell me all about the eight planets,&#x201d; and when I would try to tell her about the olden times when we used to think there were nine&#x2014;or even ten!&#x2014;planets, she would slowly shake her head and exclaim, &#x201c;Daddy, adults are so <i>stupid</i>.&#x201d; <p></p> But I was wrong. <p></p> Lilah knows all about Pluto. She has a stuffed dog, a planet lunch box, a solar system place mat at the dinner table. She feels as warmly towards the ice ball as someone ten times her age, and, like many of those older people, she is mad at the person who killed it. Lilah, though, has a solution. She recently told me, &#x201c;Daddy, I know that you had to kill Pluto, but will you promise me one thing?&#x201d; <p></p> &#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said. <p></p> &#x201c;You have to go find another planet, and when you do, you have to name it Pluto for me, OK?&#x201d; <p></p> So my search of the skies continues. <p></p><b>Mike Brown</b> is the Richard and Barbara Rosenberg Professor of Planetary Astronomy at the California Institute of Technology.

During a time of political unrest in Vietnam, he was arrested for his faith and spent the next thirteen years in prison. There he endured harsh treatment and deplorable conditions. Nine of those thirteen years he spent in solitary confinement. <br><br> During those long years of isolation and imprisonment, instead of giving in to despair and self-pity, Van Thuan learned his greatest lesson. He found God in the darkness; he was never alone, never without comfort. He discovered that his life still had purpose, even in the midst of incredible suffering. He began using scraps of paper to compose messages of hope and courage for his fellow believers, which were smuggled out and eventually published. These short messages of encouragement, 1,001 in total, were instantly popular with the Vietnamese people, many of whom also knew what it was like to suffer for their faith.<br><br> And now, from the damp darkness of a prison cell thousands of miles away, these messages of hope and light have passed through barbed wire, traveled across oceans, and been handed down over many years to speak to your heart today to offer you hope and light for your path.</p><p>Cardinal Francis Xavier Nguyen Van Thuan was a political prisoner of the Communist regime in Vietnam for thirteen years, nine of which he spent in solitary confinement. His remarkable faith sustained him during those long years when he would celebrate Mass in secret with three drops of wine in the palm of his hand and the host smuggled inside a flashlight by his faithful. His spiritual writings, penned on the back of old calendars, have spread throughout the world inspiring millions. He died in 2002.</p><h2>Waiting For Christ</h2><p>Blessed John Henry Newman was one of the most beloved and well-known preachers of his time. Originally an Anglican priest, Newman converted to Catholicism and became a Catholic priest and cardinal. Known for his beautiful prose and exultant preaching, Newman has long been a source of inspiration for those in the Church. In this new and compact compilation of his sermons, you're invited to journey with Bl. John Henry Newman through Advent into Christmas and Epiphany, meditating on the coming of Christ and the Christian life. Newman's masterful knowledge of the lives of the saints, Catholic doctrine, and, above all, Sacred Scripture, will help you immerse yourself in these liturgical seasons of waiting, wondering, and joy. <p></p><p> These beautiful meditations guide you through reflections on:</p><p> - Preparing for the Lord s coming at Christmas and the end of time<br> - Our dependence upon the Lord s goodness<br> - What happens when we do not seek truth<br> - Mary s role in salvation history<br> - God s call for each and every one of us to holiness<br> - Glorifying God in the world<br> - True joy<br> - Martyrdom, affliction, and consolation<br> - Love as the one thing needful <br></p><p> Waiting for Christ provides an opportunity to spend a few minutes with Bl. John Henry Newman and Christ every day of the Advent and Christmas seasons, preparing for the coming of the Lord.</p></p><p>Blessed John Henry Newman was born in England in 1801. He spent his early adult life as an Anglican priest and academic. Involved in what was known as the Oxford Movement, a movement within Anglicanism that supported the return to some Catholic beliefs and liturgical reform, he later left the Church of England. He converted to Catholicism, was ordained a Catholic priest, and years later was made a cardinal. Newman was widely known as a powerful preacher before and after his conversion to Catholicism, and was an extremely prolific author, writing sermons, essays, poetry, hymns, and an autobiography. He died in 1890 and was beatified by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. His feast day in the Roman Catholic Church is October 9th.''Newman was a prolific and accomplished writer in many and varied genres, but I have always believed that his voice can best be heard through his sermons. Christopher Blum has captured that sweet voice by giving us a rich selection of Newman's very best sermons for Advent and Christmas to accompany us through these graced seasons.'' <p></p><p> --<b>The Most Reverend James D. Conley, STL - Bishop of Lincoln</b><br><br>''Daily meditation and prayer, much as one spends time with a friend, is an essential practice for any person who desires to have Jesus as an intimate companion. This wonderful selection of Newman's meditations enables us to draw close to Christ as we await his Nativity each year, that he may recognize us when he returns in glory.'' </p><p></p><p> --<b>Sebastian White, OP Editor-in-Chief - Magnificat (USA)</b><br><br>''These passages are superbly selected, showing that Newman's is not simply a voice from the past, but one that speaks to the needs of faith in our day. And the peculiar quality of Newman's voice is how easily he slips into the background to leave us thinking only of Christ, so that the heart of Christ speaks to our hearts through Newman's words. This book invites us to spend a few minutes each day with a man of eloquence and holiness and to be left, not with an impression of Newman, but with a longing for Christ that makes us more ready to welcome him, both in the great feast of Christmas and in the ordinary details of each day.'' </p><p></p><p> --<b>Edward Hogan, Ph.D. Academic Dean - Kenrick-Glennon Seminary</b></p></p><h2>Fairest</h2><p><p>Once upon a time, there was a girl who wanted to be pretty . . .</p><p>Aza's singing is the fairest in all the land, and the most unusual.

Larger than most humans in Ayortha, 15-year-old Aza feels like "an ugly ox . . . a blemish." But in a kingdom devoted to song, Aza's voice is more beautiful and powerful than most; she can mimic any voice and throw the sound. At the king's wedding, Aza is blackmailed by the new queen, a poor singer, into a Cyrano de Bergerac arrangement: when the queen sings in public, Aza secretly provides the sound. As the queen's treachery deepens, Aza is astonished when the handsome prince initiates a friendship. In subtle details, Levine slowly reveals that the roots of the richly imagined story are cleverly tangled in the fairy tale "Sleeping Beauty." The telling, in Aza's voice, is sophisticated, and readers may initially feel like foreign travelers who lack cultural context. But once connections become clear, they'll sink into the fairy-tale romance, the remarkable characters, and the wild, magical adventures. They will also recognize the questions about self-image and moral choices and experience the vicarious, heart-pounding thrill when Aza discovers love and confidence: "I strode away, feeling a thousand feet tall, and glad to be for the first time in my life. Kisses were better than potions." For a slightly older audience than Levine's <i>Ella Enchanted </i>(1997), this book makes a natural partner to Donna Jo Napoli's fractured fairy-tale novels, such as <i>Beast </i>(2000). <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Boswell was the biggest farmer in America. He built a secret empire while thumbing his nose at nature, politicians, labor unions and every journalist who ever tried to lift the veil on the ultimate "factory in the fields." <i>The King of California</i> is the previously untold account of how a Georgia slave-owning family migrated to California in the early 1920s,drained one of America 's biggest lakes in an act of incredible hubris and carved out the richest cotton empire in the world. Indeed, the sophistication of Boswell 's agricultural operation -from lab to field to gin - is unrivaled anywhere.<br><br>Much more than a business story, this is a sweeping social history that details the saga of cotton growers who were chased from the South by the boll weevil and brought their black farmhands to California. It is a gripping read with cameos by a cast of famous characters, from Cecil B. DeMille to Cesar Chavez.<br><br></p><p><b>Mark Arax</b> is a bestselling author and journalist whose writings on California and the West have received numerous awards for literary nonfiction.

G. Boswell controls the biggest farming empire in America. In the early part of the twentieth century, his family moved from Georgia to California, where they drained one of the country's biggest lakes, Tulare Lake, and planted cotton. Soon their cotton empire became the richest and most technologically sophisticated on the planet. This book is many stories, all rolled into one epic. It's the story of the Boswells from the 1800s to the present day; of cotton farming in America; of California itself; and of the evolution of race relations as the country dragged itself out of the era of slavery and, not at all smoothly, into the modern era. Written in a lively style that matches the bigger-than-life qualities of its subject, the book is far more exciting than you might think the story of a cotton farmer would be. With proper marketing, it could smash through genre barriers and become the <i>Seabiscuit</i> of agricultural biography! <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

So it's simple for Sid, a six-dinner cat, to make six different people think he belongs to them. He works hard for his suppers, with six different names and six types of behavior. But when a cough precipitates six visits to the animal hospital, he is found out by the observant vet. His owners agree to make sure he receives only one meal a day, but since Sid is six-dinner cat, he just moves to Pythagoras Place where the neighbors do talk to one another and don't mind sharing dinner with him. Moore's large, colored pencil illustrations are realistic and fill the pages. She is especially strong in portraying individualized characters in the multiethnic neighborhood and the wonderful feline playfulness and insouciance of Sid. The text is rhythmic and the plot is one that children can follow and enjoy. Moore's text and lush illustrations work together to create a book that can be shared one-on-one or with a group. Readers will be happy to have this cat come back again and again. --Marge Loch-Wouters, Menasha Public Library, WI<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Conscious Lesbian Dating &amp; Love: A Roadmap to Finding the RIght Partner and Creating the Relationship of your Dreams (Conscious Lesbian Guides)</h2><p>If you're a single lesbian who wants deeply fulfilling lasting love - or feels doubtful about ever being able to find that kind of love - this book was written for you.

The man smokes, is forty pounds overweight, and subsists on a diet of pizza, french fries, and Big Macs. He works at a stressful job that leaves him agitated at the end of every fourteen-hour day, and his most strenuous exercise is walking from his office to the parking lot. He has a family history of heart disease, and his blood pressure and cholesterol are through the roof.</p><p>"Okay," says the cardiologist after he reviews the results of the tests, conducted by the nurse and a junior associate. He himself has spent just ten minutes with this patient, and already he's late for his next appointment. "Here's something to help your cholesterol go down, and something for your pressure. You shouldn't have many side effects, though you might experience some memory problems, and, of course, a loss of sex drive. But I wouldn't worry about it. Good luck, and I'll see you in three months when your prescription runs out."</p><p>You don't even have to be a first-year medical student to see what's wrong with this picture. Wait a minute, you say. Why didn't the doctor tell his patient to stop smoking, eat better, get more exercise, and find some strategies for coping with stress? Why isn't he monitoring the patient more carefully? And why is the patient's only option medications that, while they may save his life, will make it even less pleasant?</p><p>At this point, we'd never think of treating heart disease in such a limited fashion. It may have taken a while, but both the medical community and the general public have finally adopted an integrated approach to this potentially fatal illness. Yet depression -- once viewed entirely as a psychological or spiritual problem -- is now treated almost exclusively with medication alone by the vast majority of the medical establishment. While it's hard to imagine the cardiologist who would treat a heart patient in the way I've described, some version of this scenario would be not at all unusual for a harried psychiatrist at an HMO, under pressure to find the quickest and most cost-effective treatment for depression, nor for the family doctors who prescribe antidepressants while ignoring their patients' diet, exercise, and lifestyle. Even responsible, caring physicians -- psychiatrists as well as general practitioners -- are unaware that depression requires a "brain-healthy" diet and lifestyle to mirror the "heart-healthy" regime that we've come to know so well. Even well-meaning psychiatrists tend to see depressed patients as brain chemistry gone awry rather than as a complex integration of mind, body, and spirit. And many patients who try to eat well, exercise frequently, and live a healthy life remain ignorant of the specific diet and lifestyle choices that might cure their insomnia, lift their moods, soothe their anxiety, and generally ease their depression.</p><p>Depression is a holistic illness that affects every aspect of who we are as human beings. It only makes sense to address it from every available angle, both with regard to our bodies and brain chemistry and vis-�-vis our psyches and spirits. So in this book, I offer you a revolutionary model for treating depression, one that integrates physical, mental, and spiritual approaches to help you discover "the chemistry of joy" -- that mysterious mix of body, mind, and spirit that Thoreau called "the condition of life."</p><p>I believe that no matter how much pain each of us is given to endure -- and for some of us, the burden is considerable -- we can also always access the joy that is our birthright. But to find the joy we're all meant to experience, we need to understand ourselves fully, including our physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. A program for overcoming depression that omits any one of these aspects of our humanity is almost certain to fail.</p><p><b>A Three-Step Program to Creating Joy</b></p><p>My approach to overcoming depression and creating joy is based on two decades of work as a psychiatrist who has also studied Jungian psychology, Christian theology, Buddhist philosophy, Ayurvedic medicine, and the groundbreaking mindfulness approach to physical and mental health pioneered by Jon Kabat-Zinn and Saki Santorelli. In developing the program I'll share with you here, I've drawn on the latest developments in Western biochemistry to help me understand the elegant and complex interactions that take place constantly within our extraordinary brain. I've refined my understanding of diet, exercise, and lifestyle through the Ayurvedic Mind-Body medicine I learned from my study with Deepak Chopra. And I've deepened my approach to psychotherapy by incorporating a Buddhist Psychology of Mindfulness. Together, Western science and Eastern wisdom have enabled me to create this three-step program.</p><p><b><i>Step One: Understand Your Brain</i></b></p><p>Step One is your first line of defense against depression, the techniques to which you turn when you're in the throes of a depressive episode and need immediate help. It's based on the understanding that just as the heart patient needs a "heart-healthy lifestyle," so do depressed patients need a "brain-healthy" program that includes diet, exercise, and a healthy relationship to natural cycles -- the ultradian, circadian, and seasonal rhythms that affect us more than we think.</p><p>Although by now even fast-food addicts have the guilty sense that french fries and pizza aren't exactly good for our health, very few of us realize that these poor food choices are also disastrous for our mood. Too many refined carbs and unhealthy fats play havoc with our brain chemistry as well as our weight, working against our efforts to overcome depression no matter how much medication we take.</p><p>Depending on our individual system, even apparently healthy diets can be bad for our brains. I recently met a man in his fifties who worked out regularly and had a lean, healthy physique. He ate mainly home-cooked, low-fat meals featuring high-quality proteins and fresh fruits and vegetables. But he wasn't getting the complex carbohydrates that he needed to overcome a lifelong serotonin deficiency, nor the healthy Omega-3 fats that his brain craved. As a result he suffered from anxiety, insomnia, and a tendency to depression. When he added more whole grains, legumes, and starchy vegetables into his diet, his mood, sleep, and well-being improved almost instantly. In Step One, you'll learn how to tell if you, too, are eating exactly the wrong foods to balance your brain chemistry, with concrete suggestions for how to switch to a "brain-healthy" diet.</p><p>Step One is also where I'll introduce three types that you'll continue to encounter throughout the book, although they may appear slightly different each time you meet them. One of the most exciting discoveries I've made in my practice is the way Western biochemistry, Ayurvedic Mind-Body medicine, and Buddhist psychology have all identified three distinct types, each of whom needs a different physical and emotional approach to overcoming depression. In Step One, we'll start with a Western scientific explanation, based on the balance of biochemicals in the brain. Our mood, energy level, and outlook are determined to a remarkable extent by the relationship between our levels of serotonin -- a soothing chemical -- and our supply of dopamine and norepinephrine, which stimulate us. When these chemicals go out of balance, we become depressed -- but different types of imbalance result in different categories of depression, which seem in turn to be tied to different personality types:</p><p></p><ul> <li><i>Anxious Depression:</i> People with low levels of serotonin often feel fearful, inadequate, and nervous, always worried about the future and their own inability to measure up to life's demands. They tend to hold on too tightly and may become dependent in relationships.</li><p> </p><li><i>Agitated Depression:</i> People with high levels of norepinephrine/ dopamine, possibly combined with low levels of serotonin, frequently feel angry, resentful, bitter, and despairing. They're often judgmental, demanding, and highly critical in relationships, with a tendency to push away anyone who doesn't meet their high standards.</li><p> </p><li><i>Sluggish Depression:</i> People with inadequate levels of norepinephrine and dopamine tend to slow down, sleep way too much, and have trouble concentrating or motivating themselves to work. When depressed, they often become confused and "absent," even -- or perhaps especially -- in their most intimate relationships.</li></ul><p>Because Western scientists developed these categories in terms of depression, each description represents the most extreme, unhealthy versions of each type. But all of us have tendencies in one or more of these directions, whether we're talking about an occasional "blue day" or a diagnosis of clinical depression. Thus, all of us can benefit from the diet and lifestyle recommended for our "type," once we've identified which it is.</p><p>So in Step One, you'll find out what kind of diet your brain-chemistry type requires, as well as the exercise, daily schedule, and sleep patterns that can help keep your brain chemicals in balance. Even if you've never been diagnosed with depression or don't think of yourself as depressed, you can benefit from identifying your particular brain-chemistry needs and then following the recommendations in Step One.</p><p><b><i>Step Two: Make Use of Mind-Body Medicine</i></b></p><p>Step Two is your next line of defense against depression, a further effort to rebalance your system once you've begun making the diet and lifestyle changes in Step One. It's based on the principles of Ayurveda, an ancient system of Mind-Body medicine used for centuries in India and neighboring countries. Since this healing system has been around for several centuries, imagine my surprise when I realized that it basically offered more a spiritual and poetic version of the same three brain-chemistry types that Western medicine had identified -- co...</p></p><h2>Gardening for Birds, Butterflies, and Bees: Everything you need to Know to Create a wildlife Habitat in your Backyard</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re installing a new garden bed or trying to attract orioles for the first time, it helps to start with the right information.

In it Professor Dawkins articulates a gene's eye view of evolution - a view giving centre stage to these persistent units of information, and in which organisms can be seen as vehicles for the replication of genes. The book provoked widespread and heated debate, which in part led Dawkins to write <em>The Extended Phenotype</em>, in which he gave a deeper clarification of the central concept of the gene as the unit of selection, as well as contributing his own development of this insight.<br><br>For the first time, <em>The Extended Selfish Gene</em> brings these two books together, by including two key chapters from <em>The Extended Phenotype</em>. These chapters provide Dawkins's detailed and powerful response to two issues raised by critics of <em>The Selfish Gene</em>: the accusations of genetic determinism (the idea that our behaviour is entirely determined by our genes), and of "adaptationism" (that all traits are indiscriminately perceived to be adaptations resulting from natural selection). While written in particular for the biology community, Dawkins's clarity of expression allows these chapters to be accessible to all who are seriously engaged with the gene's eye view and its implications.<br><br>The imaginative, powerful, and stylistically brilliant <em>Selfish Gene</em> not only brought the insights of Neo-Darwinism to a wide audience, but galvanized the biology community, generating much debate and stimulating whole new areas of research. Forty years later, its insights remain as significant as on the day it was published. Along with the two extra chapters, <em>The Extended Selfish Gene</em> includes a new epilogue to <em>The Selfish Gene</em> from the author which highlights the relevance of the gene's eye view to evolutionary biology today.<br></p><p><br><strong>Professor Richard Dawkins</strong>, <em>Emeritus Fellow of New College, Oxford,</em> is one of the most influential science writers and communicators of our generation.

He was<br>fishing on the north shore of Chew Valley Lake, a 1200-acre<br>reservoir at the foot of the Mendip Hills south of Bristol. He<br>had already taken three brown trout of respectable weight.<br><br>He watched keenly for a telltale swirl in the calm lake<br>where he had cast. The conditions were promising. It was an<br>evening late in September, the sky was overcast and the flies<br>in their millions had just whirled above him in their spectacular<br>sunset flight, soaring and swooping over the lake in a<br>mass darker and more dense than the clouds, their droning<br>as resonant as a train in the underground. The day&#x2019;s hatch,<br>irresistible to hungry fish.<br><br>A light south-westerly fretted the surface around him, yet<br>ahead there was this bar of water, known to fishermen as the<br>scum, that showed a different pattern in the fading light.<br>There, he knew by experience, the fish preferred to rise.<br><br>So preoccupied was the man that he failed altogether to<br>notice a pale object at closer proximity. It drifted languidly<br>in the current created by the wind, more than half submerged,<br>with a slight rocking motion that fitfully produced<br>a semblance of life.<br><br>Finally it touched him. A white hand slid against his<br>thigh. A complete arm angled outwards as the body lodged<br>against him, trapped at the armpit. It was a dead woman,<br>face-up and naked.<br><br>The fisherman glanced down. From high in his throat<br>came a childishly shrill, indrawn cry.<br><br>For a moment he stood as if petrified. Then he made an<br>effort to gather himself mentally so as to disentangle himself<br>from the undesired embrace. Unwilling to touch the<br>corpse with his hands, he used the handle of the rod as a<br>lever, lodging the end in the armpit and pushing the body<br>away from him, turning it at the same time, then stepping<br>aside to let it move on its way with the current. That accomplished,<br>he grabbed his net from its anchorage in the mud<br>and, without even stopping to reel in his line, splashed his<br>way to the bank. There, he looked about him. No one was<br>in sight.<br><br>This angler was not public-spirited. His response to the<br>discovery was to bundle his tackle together and move off to<br>his car as fast as possible.<br><br>He did have one judicious thought. Before leaving, he<br>opened the bag containing his catch and threw the three<br>trout back into the water.<br>TWO <br><br>A LITTLE AFTER 10.30 THE same Saturday evening,<br>Police Constable Harry Sedgemoor and his wife Shirley<br>were watching a horror video in their terraced cottage in<br>Bishop Sutton, on the eastern side of the lake. PC Sedgemoor<br>had come off duty at six. His long body was stretched<br>along the length of the sofa, his bare feet projecting over<br>one end. On this hot night he had changed into a black<br>singlet and shorts. A can of Malthouse Bitter was in his left<br>hand, while his right was stroking Shirley&#x2019;s head, idly teasing<br>out the black curls and feeling them spring back into<br>shape. Shirley, after her shower dressed only in her white<br>cotton nightie, reclined on the floor, propped against the<br>sofa. She had her eyes closed. She had lost interest in the<br>film, but she didn&#x2019;t object to Harry watching if it resulted<br>afterwards in his snuggling up close to her in bed, as he<br>usually did after watching a horror film. Secretly, she suspected<br>he was more scared by them than she, but you didn&#x2019;t<br>suggest that sort of thing to your husband, particularly if he<br>happened to be a policeman. So she waited patiently for<br>it to end. The tape hadn&#x2019;t much longer to run. Harry had<br>several times pressed the fast-forward button to get through<br>boring bits of conversation.<br><br>The violins on the video soundtrack were working up to<br>a piercing crescendo when the Sedgemoors both heard the<br>click of their own front gate. Shirley said bitterly, &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t<br>believe it! What time is it?&#x2019;<br><br>Her husband sighed, swung his legs off the sofa, got up<br>and looked out of the window. &#x2018;Some woman.&#x2019; He couldn&#x2019;t<br>see much in the porch light.<br><br>He recognized the caller when he opened the door:<br>Miss Trenchard-Smith, who lived alone in one of the older<br>houses at the far end of the village. An upright seventy-yearold<br>never seen without her Tyrolean hat, which over the<br>years had faded in colour from a severe brown to a shade<br>that was starting to fit in with the deep pink of the local<br>stone.<br><br>&#x2018;I hesitate to disturb you so late, Officer,&#x2019; she said as her<br>eyes travelled over his shorts and singlet in a series of rapid<br>jerks. &#x2018;However, I think you will agree that what I have found<br>is sufficiently serious to justify this intrusion.&#x2019; Her gratingly<br>genteel accent articulated the words with self-importance.<br>She may have lived in the village since the war, but she<br>would never pass as local and probably didn&#x2019;t care to.<br>PC Sedgemoor said with indulgence, &#x2018;What might that<br>be, Miss Trenchard-Smith?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A dead body.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A body?&#x2019; He fingered the tip of his chin and tried to<br>appear unperturbed, but his pulses throbbed. After six<br>months in the force he had yet to be called to a corpse.<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith continued with her explanation.<br>&#x2018;I was walking my cats by the lake. People don&#x2019;t believe that<br>cats like to be taken for walks, but mine do. Every evening<br>about this time. They insist on it. They won&#x2019;t let me sleep if<br>I haven&#x2019;t taken them out.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;A human body, you mean?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, of course. A woman. Not a stitch of clothing on<br>her, poor creature.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You&#x2019;d better show me. Is it . . . is she nearby?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;In the lake, if she hasn&#x2019;t floated away already.&#x2019;<br><br>Sedgemoor refrained from pointing out that the body<br>would remain in the lake even if it had floated away. He<br>needed Miss Trenchard-Smith&#x2019;s co-operation. He invited<br>her into the cottage for a moment while he ran upstairs to<br>collect a sweater and his personal radio.<br><br>Shirley, meanwhile, had stood up and wished a good evening<br>to Miss Trenchard-Smith, whose tone in replying made<br>it plain that in her view no respectable woman ought to be<br>seen in her nightwear outside the bedroom.<br><br>&#x2018;What a horrid experience for you!&#x2019; Shirley remarked,<br>meaning what had happened beside the lake. &#x2018;Would you<br>care for a nip of something to calm you down?&#x2019;<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith curtly thanked her and declined.<br>&#x2018;But you can look after my cats while I&#x2019;m gone,&#x2019; she said as<br>if bestowing a favour on Shirley. &#x2018;You don&#x2019;t mind cats, do<br>you?&#x2019; Without pausing to get an answer she went to the door<br>and called, &#x2018;Come on, come on, come on,&#x2019; and two Siamese<br>raced from the shadows straight into the cottage and leapt<br>on to the warm spot Harry had vacated on the sofa as if it<br>were prearranged.<br><br>When Harry came down again, Shirley glanced at what<br>he was wearing and said, &#x2018;I thought you were going upstairs<br>to put some trousers on.&#x2019;<br><br>He said, &#x2018;I might have to wade in and fetch something<br>out, mightn&#x2019;t I?&#x2019;<br><br>She shuddered.<br><br>He picked his torch off the shelf by the door. Managing<br>to sound quite well in control, he said, &#x201c;Bye, love.&#x2019; He<br>kissed Shirley lightly and tried to provide more reassurance<br>by whispering, &#x2018;I expect she imagined it.&#x2019;<br><br>Not that tough old bird, Shirley thought. If she says she<br>found a corpse, it&#x2019;s there.<br><br>Harry Sedgemoor was less certain. While driving Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith the half-mile or so down to the lakeside<br>he seriously speculated that she might be doing this out<br>of a desire to enliven her placid routine with gratuitous<br>excitement. Old women living alone had been known to<br>waste police time with tall stories. If this were the case he<br>would be incensed. He was damned sure Shirley wouldn&#x2019;t<br>want to make love after this. Whatever there might or<br>might not be in the lake, the mention of a corpse would<br>colour her imagination so vividly that nothing he did or<br>said would relax her.<br><br>With an effort to be the policeman, he asked Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith to tell him where to stop the car.<br><br>&#x2018;Anywhere you like,&#x2019; she said with an ominously nonchalant<br>air. &#x2018;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea where we are.&#x2019;<br><br>He halted where the road came to an end. They got out<br>and started across a patch of turf, his torch probing the<br>space ahead. The reservoir was enclosed by a low boundary<br>fence, beyond which clumps of reeds stirred in the breeze,<br>appearing to flicker in the torchlight. At intervals were flat<br>stretches of shoreline.<br><br>&#x2018;How exactly did you get down to the water?&#x2019; he asked.<br><br>&#x2018;Through one of the gates.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Those are for fishermen only.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t disturb them.&#x2019; She gave a laugh. &#x2018;I won&#x2019;t tell anyone<br>you broke the law.&#x2019;<br><br>He pushed open a gate and they picked their way down<br>to the water&#x2019;s edge.<br><br>&#x2018;Was this the place?&#x2019;<br><br>She said, &#x2018;It all looks amazingly different now.&#x2019;<br><br>Containing his annoyance, he drew the torch-beam<br>slowly across a wide angle. &#x2018;You must have some idea. How<br>did you notice the body?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;There was still some daylight then.&#x2019;<br><br>Fifty yards along the bank was a place where the reeds<br>grew extra tall. &#x2018;Anywhere like that?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I suppose there&#x2019;s no harm in looking,&#x2019; she said.<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why we&#x2019;re here, miss.&#x2019;<br><br>He stepped in and felt his foot sink into soft mud. &#x2018;You&#x2019;d<br>better stay where you are,&#x2019; he told Miss Trenchard-Smith.<br>He worked his way through to the far side. Nothing was<br>there except a family of ducks that put up a noisy protest.<br><br>He returned.<br><br>She said, &#x2018;Just look at the state of your gym shoes!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re looking for a body, miss,&#x2019; PC Sedgemoor reminded<br>her. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got to do the job properly.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;If you&#x2019;re going to wade through every clump of reeds,<br>we&#x2019;ll be out all night,&#x2019; she said blithely.<br><br>Twenty minutes&#x2019; searching resulted only in Miss<br>Trenchard-Smith becoming more flippant and PC Sedgemoor<br>less patient. They moved steadily along the shoreline.<br>He shone the torch on his watch, thinking bitterly of Shirley<br>alone in the cottage with those unlikeable cats while he<br>danced attendance on this scatty old maid. Almost 11.30.<br>What a Saturday night! In an impatient gesture he swung<br>the beam rapidly across the whole width of the water as if<br>to demonstrate the futility of the task. And perversely that<br>was the moment when Miss Trenchard-Smith said, &#x2018;There!&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Where?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Give me the torch,&#x2019; she said.<br><br>He handed it to her and watched as she held it at arm&#x2019;s<br>length. The beam picked out something white in the water.<br><br>PC Sedgemoor took a short, quick breath. &#x2018;What do you<br>know?&#x2019; he said in a whisper. &#x2018;You were right.&#x2019;<br><br>The body had lodged among the reeds not more than<br>ten feet from where they stood, in a place where waterweed,<br>bright viridian in the torchlight, grew densely. Unquestionably<br>a woman, face upwards, her long hair splayed in the<br>water, a strand of it across her throat. The pale flesh was<br>flecked with seedpods. No wounds were apparent. Sedgemoor<br>was reminded of a painting he had once seen on a<br>school trip to London: a woman lying dead among reeds, evidently<br>drowned. It had impressed him because the teacher<br>had said that the model had been forced to lie for hours<br>in a bath in the artist&#x2019;s studio and one day the artist had<br>forgotten to fill the lamps that were provided to keep the<br>water warm. As a result the girl had contracted an illness that<br>didn&#x2019;t immediately kill her, but certainly shortened her life.<br><br>The story had been given to the class as an example of<br>obsessive fidelity to the subject. Sedgemoor had stood in<br>front of the painting until the teacher had called his name<br>sharply from the next room, for it had been the only painting<br>of a dead person he had seen, and death is fascinating to<br>children. Now, faced with an actual drowned corpse, he was<br>made acutely aware how idealized the Pre-Raphaelite image<br>had been. It wasn&#x2019;t merely that the girl in the painting had<br>been clothed. Her hands and face had lain elegantly on the<br>surface of the water. The face of the real drowned woman<br>was submerged, drawn under by the weight of the head.<br>The belly was uppermost, and it was swollen. The skin on<br>the breasts had a puckered appearance. The hands hung<br>too low to be visible at all.<br><br>&#x2018;There&#x2019;s a wind blowing up,&#x2019; said Miss Trenchard-Smith.<br><br>&#x2018;Yes,&#x2019; he responded in a preoccupied way.<br><br>&#x2018;If you don&#x2019;t do something about it, she&#x2019;ll drift away again.&#x2019;<br><br>The duty inspector at &#x2018;F&#x2019; Division in Yeovil picked out the<br>significant word from PC Sedgemoor&#x2019;s call. &#x2018;Naked&#x2019; meant<br>a full alert. You can generally rule out accident or suicide<br>if you discover a naked corpse in a lake. &#x2018;And you say you<br>handled it? Was that necessary? All right, lad. Stay where<br>you are. I mean that literally. Stand on the spot. Don&#x2019;t trample<br>the ground. Don&#x2019;t touch the corpse again. Don&#x2019;t smoke,<br>comb your hair, scratch your balls, anything.&#x2019;<br><br>Sedgemoor was compelled to ignore the instruction. He<br>hadn&#x2019;t cared to admit that he was calling in from the car,<br>where he had stupidly left his personal radio. He set off at a<br>trot, back to the lakeside.<br><br>Miss Trenchard-Smith stood by the body in the darkness,<br>sublimely unconcerned. &#x2018;I switched off the torch to save<br>your battery.&#x2019;<br><br>He told her that assistance was on the way and he would<br>see that she was taken home shortly.<br><br>&#x2018;I hope not,&#x2019; she said. &#x2018;I&#x2019;d like to help.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Decent of you to offer, miss,&#x2019; said Sedgemoor. &#x2018;With<br>respect, the CID won&#x2019;t need any help.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;<i>You</i> were glad of it, young man.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes.&#x2019;<br><br>She was unstoppable. Women of her mettle had climbed<br>the Matterhorn in long skirts and chained themselves to<br>railings. &#x2018;They&#x2019;ll want to identify her,&#x2019; she said with relish.<br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m no Sherlock Holmes, but I can tell them several<br>things already. She was married, proud of her looks and her<br>shoes pinched. And it appears to me as if she had red hair.<br>It looked dark brown when you first brought her out, but I<br>would say on closer examination that it was a rather fetching<br>shade of chestnut red, wouldn&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; She switched on<br>the torch and bent over the face admiringly as if it had none<br>of the disfigurement caused by prolonged submersion. &#x2018;No<br>wonder she let it grow.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t touch!&#x2019; Sedgemoor cautioned her.<br><br>But she already had a lock of hair between finger and<br>thumb. &#x2018;Just feel how fine it is. Don&#x2019;t be squeamish.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It isn&#x2019;t that&#x2014;it&#x2019;s procedure. You don&#x2019;t handle anything.&#x2019;<br><br>She looked up, smiling. &#x2018;Come now, you just dragged her<br>out of the water. Touching her hair won&#x2019;t make a jot of difference.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve had orders,&#x2019; he said stiffly. &#x2018;And I must request you<br>to co-operate.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;As you wish.&#x2019; She straightened up and used the torch<br>to justify her deductions. &#x2018;The mark of a wedding ring on<br>the left hand. Traces of nail polish on the toes as well as the<br>fingernails. Cramped toes and redness on the backs of the<br>heels. Neither a farmgirl nor a feminist, my dear Watson.<br>Where are they? They ought to be here by now.&#x2019;<br><br>It was with distinct relief that Sedgemoor spotted across<br>the landscape the flashing light of a police vehicle.

To save humanity, the trio must fight their way to the tunnels of Black Smoke Mountain--the lair of the mythical Demon Mother.<br><br>Alien: Phalanx TM &amp; � 2019 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.

Fortunately for those on the hunt for dried black limes, Persian food has been at the crest of a rising tide of Middle Eastern books these past few years. Ghayour interpets the many species of rice dishes and long-simmered stews in a way that's more approachable than what you'll find in traditional Persian cookbooks; when she ventures elsewhere in the Mediterranean (bastillas, kebabs, baklava, tabbouleh) she paves the way with smart substitutions and thoughtful headnotes. And she remains true to her palette pomegranate, dates, barberries, saffron, pistachio, dill even when experimenting with Western forms (as in pistachio-rose-raspberry madeleines). All in all, Persiana stands out as a quiet gem amid many more widely recognized but ultimately less useful Middle Eastern cookbooks released this year. --NPR Best Cookbooks of 2014<br><br>I ve come down with a strange disease for which their may be no cure. Call it a case of the creeping Ottolenghis. <br><br>Ever since I started cooking from British chef and cookbook writer Yotam Ottolenghi s phenomenal Plenty a couple of years ago, I ve found my tastes shifting gradually eastward. I'm reaching for feta and mint instead of mozzarella and basil. Rice and whole grains are taking the place of dried pasta. And I m buying tahineh and yogurt in what seems like industrial quantities.<br><br>Still, even as my dinners are becoming progressively lighter, brighter and more herbaceous, I find myself wanting to push even further into the cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East.<br><br>Fortunately, it seems the Ottolenghi effect has not escaped the notice of the publishing industry either here or in Britain.

Ghayour s food is both sophisticated and approachable a tough line to tread, particularly with cuisines and ingredients that might be unfamiliar. But consider a dish like her tagine of lamb, butternut squash, prune and tamarind it's just 11 ingredients including spices, but the flavors jump off the page.

But I happen to feel that chicken breasts can be awfully dry if not cooked properly. This recipe, when done right, retains moisture in the breast, and the combination of ingredients gives it a rich and savory complexity of flavors. All you need to serve with it is a tossed salad, and you have a complete meal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Serves 6<br> &nbsp;<br> 6 medium boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 6 ounces each)<br> 1 teaspoon kosher salt<br> All- purpose flour, for dredging<br> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter<br> 4 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil<br> 12 large shiitake mushrooms, stems removed<br> 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed<br> 6 fresh sage leaves<br> � cup white wine<br> � cup prepared tomato sauce<br> 6 tablespoons grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> &nbsp;<br> Pound the chicken to about �- inch thickness (or butterfly to the same thickness). Season the chicken with � teaspoon of salt. Dredge the chicken lightly in the fl our and tap off any excess. In a large cast- iron skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium heat. Lightly brown the chicken on both sides, about 2 minutes per side, then remove to a plate.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once the chicken is out of the skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, mushroom caps, and garlic. Season with the remaining � teaspoon of salt. Drizzle with � cup of water, and cook until the mushrooms are softened and the water evaporates, about 4 minutes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Slide the mushrooms to the side, and put the chicken back in the pan, in one layer, and arrange two mushroom caps on top of each piece. Increase the heat to medium- high, and add the sage leaves and the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, in pieces, in the spaces in the pan. Pour the white wine and tomato sauce into the spaces in the pan as well. Sprinkle each chicken breast with 1 tablespoon of the grated cheese. Cover, and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. Uncover, increase heat to reduce the sauce to your liking, and serve.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> OREGANO EGGS<br> Uova all&#x2019;Origano<br> &nbsp;<br> This is one of the simplest and yet tastiest preparations of eggs I&#x2019;ve ever had. One afternoon, a friend and I unexpectedly dropped in on my friend Mario in Trieste. It was lunchtime, and he had a big basket full of fresh eggs he had brought down from the Carso, the high plateau surrounding Trieste. Eggs it was for lunch, served with a bowl of radicchio salad. We were just a few people that day, but this recipe is so very easy to modify for smaller or larger groups.<br> &nbsp;<br> Serves 4<br> &nbsp;<br> 2 tablespoons extra- virgin olive oil<br> 8 large eggs<br> � teaspoon kosher salt<br> � teaspoon dried oregano<br> � cup grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano-Reggiano<br> &nbsp;<br> Set a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over a burner that&#x2019;s still off. Swirl the pan with the olive oil, and gently break all the eggs to fill the pan, taking care not to break the yolks. Sprinkle with the salt and dried oregano. Sprinkle the grated cheese over all.<br> &nbsp;<br> Cover the skillet, and turn the flame to medium- low. Cook until the whites are set and the yolks are done to your liking, about 7 to 8 minutes for still- runny yolks. This is a great breakfast or main course, or, served over some arugula, it can be an appetizer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quick Tip:<br> It can be difficult to crack eggs into a skillet for frying. Instead, you can crack two eggs into a small glass bowl and then slide them into the skillet when it&#x2019;s hot.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ALMOND AND COFFEE CREAM MINI- TARTS<br> Tartellette alla Crema di Mandorle e Caff�<br><br> These mini-tarts are delightful as a finger-food dessert, and although here they are coffee almond-flavored, you can change the flavoring according to your liking or what you have. A simple egg custard with some jam at the bottom of these tarts can be a great option.<br> &nbsp;<br> Serves 8<br> &nbsp;<br> Dough<br> 2 cups all- purpose flour<br> 3 tablespoons sugar<br> � teaspoon kosher salt<br> 12 tablespoons unsalted cold butter, cut into pieces (1� sticks)<br> 3 egg yolks<br> 2 tablespoons ice water, plus more as needed<br><br>Coffee Cream<br> 1� cups milk<br> 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder<br> 3 large egg yolks<br> 6 tablespoons sugar<br> Pinch kosher salt<br> 2 tablespoons cornstarch<br> 1 tablespoon all- purpose flour<br> � teaspoon almond extract<br> � cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks<br> � cup sliced almonds, toasted, for serving<br> &nbsp;<br> For the dough: In a food processor, pulse together the flour, sugar, and salt. Drop in the butter, and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse crumbs. Beat together the egg yolks and water, and pour into the processor. Pulse until the dough just comes together, adding a little water if crumbly, or a little flour if it is too wet. On the counter, knead the dough a few times; then flatten it into a disk, wrap in plastic, and chill for at least 30 minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to about �&#x2044;8-inch thick. Cut out eight rounds to fit into eight individual 4 �- inch fluted mini- tart pans. Fit the dough into the pans, and trim so the dough is flush with the rims. Chill for 15 minutes, then place on a sheet pan. Dock the dough with a fork, and place parchment circles filled with pie weights or beans in each tart. Bake until the dough is set but still blond in color, about 10 minutes. Remove the parchment and the weights, and continue baking until the dough is crisp and golden, about 10 to 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven, and cool on racks. <br> &nbsp;<br> For the coffee cream: In a saucepan, bring the milk just to a simmer, and whisk in the espresso powder. In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, salt, cornstarch, and flour until smooth. Whisk in the hot milk a little at a time, tempering the eggs. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan over low heat until it just begins to simmer and thickens. Strain it into a clean bowl, stir in the almond extract, and chill, covering the surface with plastic wrap to keep it from forming a skin.<br> When the cream is chilled, fold in the whipped cream. Dollop the coffee cream into cooled tart shells, and garnish with almonds. Serve.&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Three Californias: The Wild Shore, The Gold Coast, and Pacific Edge</h2><p><p><b>FROM THE INTERNATIONALLY BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF RED MARS AND NEW YORK 2140</b></p><p>Before Kim Stanley Robinson Robinson terraformed Mars, he wrote three science fiction novels set in Orange County, California, where he grew up.

He directs Unfettered Mind, a Buddhist teaching and consulting service in Los Angeles, CA.</p>This book's promotional material asserts that author McLeod "is no guru and has no meditation center; rather, he is a life trainer." Perhaps only in contemporary America can this be touted as an advantage for a Buddhist teacher. McLeod, no doubt, is not the least bit bothered by the implications, as he is writing expressly for "Americans in a thoroughly American way." Still, potential readers should not fear that McLeod has shortchanged them on the details of the Buddhist path. He offers very charming stories, unclouded prose, step-by-step meditations, charts and quotes from such varied sources as Bob Dylan, Milarepa, Rumi, Yogi Berra and anonymous Buddhist sayings ("Think of all sentient beings as Buddha, but keep your hand on your wallet"). McLeod delivers a hefty how-to manual that could prove useful to a single soul in the hinterlands or a sophisticated searcher in Los Angeles, where McLeod directs Unfettered Mind, a Buddhist teaching and counseling service. This text's apparent self-help style is somewhat ironic, since McLeod pointedly asks, "Can you do this work on your own?" and immediately responds, "Basically, the answer is no.... We need a teacher," going against the American apotheosis of the individual. Whether he cops to it or not, McLeod has illuminated the path for solitary individuals who want a long-lasting handbook to begin the journey toward wakefulness.

Economists, policymakers, central bankers and most people in the financial world have been blindsided by these busts, while investors have lost trillions. Economists argue that bubbles can only be spotted after they burst and that market moves are unpredictable. Yet Marathon Asset Management, a London-based investment firm managing over $50 billion of assets has developed a relatively simple method for identifying and potentially avoiding them: follow the money, or rather the trail of investment. Bubbles whether they affect a whole economy or merely a single industry, tend to attract a splurge of capital spending. Excessive investment drives down returns and leads inexorably to a bust. This was the case with both the technology bubble at the turn of the century and the US housing bubble which followed shortly after. More recently, vast sums have been invested in mining and energy. From an investor&#39;s perspective, the trick is to avoid investing in sectors, or markets, where investment spending is unduly elevated and competition is fierce, and to put one&#39;s money to work where capital expenditure is depressed, competitive conditions are more favourable and, as a result, prospective investment returns are higher. This capital cycle strategy encourages investors to eschew the simple &#39;growth&#39; and &#39;value&#39; dichotomy and identify firms that can deliver superior returns either because capital has been taken out of an industry, or because the business has strong barriers to entry (what Warren Buffett refers to as a &#39;moat&#39;). Some of Marathon&#39;s most successful investments have come from obscure, sometimes niche operations whose businesses are protected from the destructive forces of the capital cycle. Capital Returns is a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practical implementation of the capital cycle approach to investment. Edited and with an introduction by Edward Chancellor, the book brings together 60 of the most insightful reports written between 2002 and 2014 by Marathon portfolio managers. Capital Returns provides key insights into the capital cycle strategy, all supported with real life examples from global brewers to the semiconductor industry - showing how this approach can be usefully applied to different industry conditions and how, prior to 2008, it helped protect assets from financial catastrophe. This book will be a welcome reference for serious investors who looking to maximise portfolio returns over the long run.</p><p>Edward Chancellor (editor and introduction) is the author of <em>Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation</em> (FSG, 1999), a New York Times 'Notable Book of the Year' and editor of Marathon's previous book, <em>Capital Account: A Money Manager's Reports on a Turbulent Decade</em> (Thomson Texere, 2004). Mr. Chancellor is an award-winning financial journalist, who has written for the <em>Financial Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>,<em> Reuters</em> and many other publications. He is a former member of the asset allocation team at GMO, a Boston-based investment firm. <br><br>Marathon Asset Management (trading in the United States as Marathon-London) is an independent owner managed investment firm based in London.

Sullivan is intended for the general reader as well as for the student. Its primary purpose is to present the elements of philosophy with simplicity and clarity in order to arouse that sense of wonder which Aristotle says is the beginning of the love of wisdom. <br> <br> This well-structured overview begins with an historical study of philosophy, tracing the evolution of philosophical problems from their simplest origins, and continues with an analysis of the more concrete problems about man himself. The more abstract problems of man and his relation to the world around him make up the final study of this book. <br> <br> Sullivan works in the great classical, realist tradition of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and their modern-day inheritors, exposing the perennially valid and vital principles of philosophy and emphasizing the profound moral and social implications of these principles. He respects the distinction between natural and revealed wisdom, but does not hesitate to point out how the conclusions of philosophy are complemented by the truths of revelation. <br> <br> AN INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY clearly demonstrates that philosophy is a good deal more than a classroom exercise.</p><p>Intended as a first introduction to philosophy, for the general reader and the student, that cuts down on technical vocabulary as much as possible, yet conveys the full meaning of the basic philosophical questions. Covers essence and existence, rights and duties, human knowledge, happiness, the problem of change, God, etc. By far the best intro we have seen. Everything is covered from the Thomistic, realist viewpoint. Great!Daniel J. Sullivan intended <i>An Introduction to Philosophy</i> to be used by the general reader as well as the student. A secondary purpose, as mentioned in the foreword, was to smooth the transition from literary imagery to philosophical abstraction. The book was dedicated to Emmanuel C. Chapman and published in 1957 by The Bruce Publishing Company, based in Milwaukee. It received the Nihil Obstat as well as the Imprimatur and was reprinted in 1992 and again in 2009.</p><h2>The Columbian Orator</h2><p><p>First published in 1797, <b>The Columbian Orator</b> helped shape the American mind for the next half century, going through some 23 editions and totaling 200,000 copies in sales. The book was read by virtually every American schoolboy in the first half of the 19th century. As a slave youth, Frederick Douglass owned just one book, and read it frequently, referring to it as a "gem" and his "rich treasure."<br> <b>The Columbian Orator</b> presents 84 selections, most of which are notable examples of oratory on such subjects as nationalism, religious faith, individual liberty, freedom, and slavery, including pieces by Washington, Franklin, Milton, Socrates, and Cicero, as well as heroic poetry and dramatic dialogues. Augmenting these is an essay on effective public speaking which influenced Abraham Lincoln as a young politician. As America experiences a resurgence of interest in the art of debating and oratory, <b>The Columbian Orator</b>--whether as historical artifact or contemporary guidebook--is one of those rare books to be valued for what it meant in its own time, and for how its ideas have endured.

But instead&nbsp;the two join forces to vanquish the nine other far less gentle giants who threaten to consume earth&#x2019;s children. This beautiful hardcover gift edition of Dahl's classic features the original illustrations by Quentin Blake, as well as a silk ribbon marker, acid-free paper, gilt stamping on a full-cloth cover,&nbsp;decorative endpapers, and a sewn binding.<br></p></p><p>Evidently not even Roald Dahl could resist the acronym craze of the early eighties. BFG? Bellowing ferret-faced golfer? Backstabbing fairy godmother? Oh, oh ... Big Friendly Giant! This BFG doesn't seem all that F at first as he creeps down a London street, snatches little Sophie out of her bed, and bounds away with her to giant land. And he's not really all that B when compared with his evil, carnivorous brethren, who bully him for being such an oddball runt. After all, he eats only disgusting snozzcumbers, and while the other Gs are snacking on little boys and girls, he's blowing happy dreams in through their windows. What kind of way is that for a G to behave?<p> The BFG is one of Dahl's most lovable character creations. Whether galloping off with Sophie nestled into the soft skin of his ear to capture dreams as though they were exotic butterflies; speaking his delightful, jumbled, squib-fangled patois; or whizzpopping for the Queen, he leaves an indelible impression of bigheartedness. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i></p><b>Roald Dahl</b> (1916-1990) was born in Llandaff, South Wales, and went to Repton School in England. His parents were Norwegian, so holidays were spent in Norway. As he explains in <i>Boy</i>, he turned down the idea of university in favor of a job that would take him to 'a wonderful faraway place'. In 1933 he joined the Shell Company, which sent him to Mombasa in East Africa. When World War II began in 1939 he became a fighter pilot and in 1942 was made assistant air attach� in Washington, where he started to write short stories. His first major success as a writer for children was in 1964. Thereafter his children's books brought him increasing popularity, and when he died children mourned the world over, particularly in Britain where he had lived for many years.<b>The BFG</b> is dedicated to the memory of Roald Dahl's eldest daughter, Olivia, who died from measles when she was seven &#x2013; the same age at which his sister had died (fron appendicitis) over forty years before. <b>Quentin Blake</b>, the first Children&#x2019;s Laureate of the United Kingdom, has illustrated most of Roald Dahl&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s books.</p><h2>American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza</h2><p><b>Master bread baker Peter Reinhart follows the origins of pizza from Italy to the States, capturing the stories behind the greatest artisanal pizzas of the Old World and the New. </b><br><br>Beginning his journey in Genoa, Reinhart scours the countryside in search of the fabled <i>focaccia col formaggio.</i> He next heads to Rome to sample the famed seven-foot-long <i>pizza al taglio</i>, and then to Naples for the archetypal <i>pizza napoletana.</i> Back in America, the hunt resumes in the unlikely locale of Phoenix, Arizona, where Chris Bianco of Pizzeria Bianco has convinced many that his pie sets the new standard in the country. The pizza mecca of New Haven, grilled pizza in Providence, the deep-dish pies of Chicago, California-style pizza in San Francisco and Los Angeles&#x2014;these are just a few of the tasty attractions on Reinhart's epic tour. <br><br>Returning to the kitchen, Reinhart gives a master class on pizza-making techniques and provides more than 60 recipes for doughs, sauces and toppings, and the pizzas that bring them all together. His insatiable curiosity and gift for storytelling make <i>American Pie </i>essential reading for those who aspire to make great pizza at home, as well as for anyone who enjoys the thrill of the hunt.</p><p>Baking bread is mysterious enough. But creating truly great pizza--the transformation of next to nothing into something extraordinary--is downright alchemical. It is for no small reason that there are distinct words in Italian for those disciples of these mystic arts who bake pizza and focaccia, <i>pizzaiolo</i> and <i>focacciaiolo</i>. Peter Reinhart, he who gave us <i>Brother Juniper's Bread Book</i> and the multi-award winning <i>The Bread Baker's Apprentice</i>, takes the reader of <i>American Pie: My Search for the Perfect Pizza</i> right into the heart of the matter.<p> Reinhart begins his inquiry into pizza with his baseline palate memory for what a great pizza should be. As a teenager he had worked in a pizzeria, Mama's, and instinctively knew this pie to be the best. Returning as an adult years later, he discovered otherwise. Had he changed, or had the pizza changed? Both, it happened, were true.</p><p> So what is the nature of perfection, and where do you go to find it? In the case of Peter Reinhart, this journey includes travels through Italy and across the US. This is Part One of the book, called The Hunt. It's not the most enlivening travel writing, which would have helped elevate the insights into the nature of great pizza and the people who make it happen. But it's only a third of the entire package. The best is yet to come. In Part Two: The Recipes, Reinhart comes entirely into his own. Here is the master at work. Chapters include "The Family of Doughs", "Sauces and Specialty Toppings," and "The Pizzas." Reinhart gives you the building blocks, no matter what your kitchen, tools, and oven might be like. And then he unfolds the roadmap--pizzas from the strictly classical to the strictly whimsical. </p><p> Work diligently with <i>American Pie</i> and in time you will be able to call yourself, without hesitation or rising color, <i>pizzaiolo</i> and <i>focacciaiolo</i>. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>A fascinating look into the great pizzas and pizzerias of Italy and America. <p>Includes in-depth pizza-making techniques; more than 40 classic pizza recipes; and an engaging narrative of Reinhart&#x2019;s pizza hunts with such food luminaries as Rick Bayless, Jeffrey Steingarten, and Joanne Weir. </p><p>Peter Reinhart&#x2019;s last book, THE BREAD BAKER&#x2019;S APPRENTICE, was named Cookbook of the Year by both the James Beard Foundation and the International Association of Culinary Professionals.</p></p><h2>Dragonsinger (2) (Harper Hall of Pern)</h2><p>Menolly needs more than music&#x2019;s power to make it as a Harper in the second book in the Harper Hall trilogy, set within science fiction legend Anne McCaffrey&#x2019;s beloved and bestselling Dragonriders of Pern series.<br><br>In the world of Pern, Harpers are more powerful than kings, for the music they play can control the minds of others. For young Menolly, her dreams of becoming a Harper have nothing to do with power, but rather her love of music. Now she is finally living out her musical dreams as an apprentice Harper, but it&#x2019;s turning out to be more challenging than she thought. Formerly forbidden to study music because of her gender, Menolly quickly encounters hostility from a number of her male peers and masters.

The author describes the four characteristics using examples like Robert F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Prathia Hall, and the Moral Monday Movement, along with musicians and other artists of today. Moral imagination helps the hearer to see what they cannot see, to hear what they cannot hear--to inhabit the lives of others, so that they can embody Christ and true freedom for those others.&nbsp;<br> <br> This book equips and empowers preachers to transcend their basic skills and techniques, so that their proclamation of the Word causes actual turnaround in the hearts and lives of their hearers, and in their communities.&nbsp;</p> <p>"Frank Thomas has written a passionate summons: amid the current destructive chaos of our society there is an urgent need for moral imagination. Such imagination is the antithesis of &#x201c;diabolic&#x201d; and &#x201c;idolatrous&#x201d; imagination that is all to the fore in our public discourse and practice. Thomas fleshes out &#x201c;moral imagination&#x201d; with close reflection on the practice of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Before he finishes Thomas shows how the urgency of &#x201c;moral imagination&#x201d; belongs peculiarly to the work of the preacher. This book is a welcome call for gospel-grounded courage and truth about the neighbor issued in a way that refuses the self-serving fakery that dominates our public life."&nbsp;--Walter Brueggemann, Columbia Theological Seminary</p> <p>"Timely and prophetic, <em>How to Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em> presents a homiletic essential for our churches today. Thomas insists that it is up to the preacher to recapture and reclaim the moral imagination of our nation so that the Gospel&#x2019;s message of freedom is true for all people. With attention to specific figures whose witness models the qualities and characteristics of moral imagination, Thomas inspires the preacher toward powerful proclamation that both challenges and critiques any speech that subjugates or subordinates. <em>How to Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em> is must read for preachers to recover and reimagine the leadership role of the church for the sake of justice for all."&nbsp;--Karoline M. Lewis, Associate Professor of Biblical Preaching and the Marbury E. Anderson Chair of Biblical Preaching, Luther Seminary; author of<em> She: Five Keys to Unlock the Power of Women in Ministry.</em></p> <p>"In this lucid and compelling book, Frank Thomas plumbs the depths of American moral rhetoric for insights that will help preachers. <em>How to Preach a Dangerous Sermon</em> provides new and dramatic ways in which the moral imagination in a democratic society can be nurtured by visionary, empathic, wise, and artistic preachers."--John S. McClure, Charles G. Finney Professor of Preaching and Worship, Vanderbilt Divinity School</p> "Warning: Preachers, if you are comfortable with the status quo of white privilege, patriarchy, hetero-normativity, and classism, do not read this book. If you are comfortable with sermon series that reduce the gospel to self-help acronyms, don&#x2019;t read this book. But if you have the courage to look honestly at our landscape and bring the moral imagination of the Christian tradition to bear on it, open these pages and your sermons may never be the same again. But then again neither will the church--or the world--be the same anymore, if enough of us follow Thomas&#x2019;s advice." --O.

Tonight, however, things are different. Tonight the city is on edge, a hive of hurried, sometimes violent activity; its citizens bustle about, barring doors, shuttering windows, avoiding any stranger's stare. Because tonight there is to be a convergence, the once-in-a-generation appearance of a Shadow Moon &#x2013; an occasion that threatens the good people of Malaz with demon hounds and other, darker things ... </p><p>It was also prophesied that this night would witness the return of Emperor Kellanved, and there are those prepared to do anything to prevent this happening. As factions within the greater Empire draw up battle lines over the imperial throne, the Shadow Moon summons a far more ancient and potent presence for an all-out assault upon the island. Witnessing these cataclysmic events are Kiska, a young girl who yearns to flee the constraints of the city, and Temper, a grizzled, battle-weary veteran who seeks simply to escape his past. Each is to play a part in a conflict that will not only determine the fate of Malaz City, but also of the world beyond ... </p><p>Drawing on events touched on in the prologue of Steven Erikson's landmark fantasy <i>Gardens of the Moon,</i> <i>Night of Knives</i> is a momentous chapter in the unfolding story of the extraordinarily imagined world of Malaz.</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Cameron Esslemont</b> was born in Winnipeg, Canada.

He now lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, with his wife and children and is currently working on his PhD in English Literature and writing another novel set in the world of the Malaz, a world he co-created with his friend Steven Erikson.</p>Starred Review. Steven Erickson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series only hints at the empire's distant history, which Esslemont, cocreator of the original world, explores in this dark, powerful novel (first published in the U.K. in 2004) and its planned sequels. On a Shadow Moon night on the Isle of Malaz, dead souls rise and demonlike hounds attack any who dare to leave their homes. Knowing that Emperor Kellanved is prophesied to use the Shadow Moon for his own ends, the emperor's enemies gather on the small island for their own nefarious purposes, starting a plot that spirals into bloody violence. Esslemont nails the feel and flavor of Erickson's books and brings the historical characters to life with a dexterity that will win over even the most skeptical fans. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Ellis brings his unparalleled talents to this riveting account of the early years of the Republic.</p><p>The last quarter of the eighteenth century remains the most politically creative era in American history, when a dedicated group of men undertook a bold experiment in political ideals. It was a time of both triumphs and tragedies&#x2014;all of which contributed to the shaping of our burgeoning nation. Ellis casts an incisive eye on the gradual pace of the American Revolution and the contributions of such luminaries as Washington, Jefferson, and Madison, and brilliantly analyzes the failures of the founders to adequately solve the problems of slavery and the treatment of Native Americans. With accessible prose and stunning eloquence, Ellis delineates in <b>American Creation</b> an era of flawed greatness, at a time when understanding our origins is more important than ever.</p></p><p><p>JOSEPH J. ELLIS is the author of many works of American history including&nbsp;<i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</i>, which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; and&nbsp;<i>American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson,</i>&nbsp;which won the National Book Award. He recently retired from his position as the Ford Foundation Professor of History at Mount Holyoke College and lives in Amherst, Massachusetts, with his wife and their youngest son.</p><b>Chapter One: The Year</b>If permitted the historical license to stretch the definition of a year, then the fifteen months between the shots fired at Lexington and Concord in April of 1775 and the adoption of the Declaration of Independence in July of 1776 can justifiably claim to be both the most consequential and the strangest year in American history. It was consequential because the rationale for American independence and the political agenda for an independent American republic first became explicit at this time. It was strange because while men were dying, whole towns being burned to the ground, women being raped, captured spies and traitors being executed, the official posture of what called itself &#x201c;The United Colonies of North America&#x201d; remained abiding loyalty to the British Crown.[1]Whether the American colonists were living a lie, an illusion, or a calculated procrastination is a good question. But when Thomas Jefferson finally got around to drafting the Declaration of Independence in June of 1776, one sentence enjoyed special resonance as an accurate characterization of the past year: &#x201c;Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.&#x201d; This was Jefferson&#x2019;s lyrical way of describing the quite remarkable feat of making an explosion happen in slow motion.After all, prudence does not ordinarily make its way onto any list of revolutionary virtues. The very idea of a cautious revolutionary would seem, on the face of it, a contradiction in terms. The standard story of most revolutions features a cast of desperate characters with impulsive temperaments, utopian visions, a surefire sense of where history is headed, and an unquenchable urge to get there fast. Indeed, tarrying along the way is usually regarded as counterrevolutionary.If that is what the standard story of a revolution requires, then one of two conclusions about the American Revolution follows naturally: either it was not really a revolution at all but merely (or perhaps not so merely) a war for colonial independence, the first of its kind in the modern world, to be sure, but not a fundamental shift in the social order that left the world changed forever. Or else it was a strange kind of revolution that did not fit the standard pattern because many of its most prominent leaders were convinced that the pace of change must be slowed down and the most radical of the revolutionary promises deferred. The result is another contradiction, or perhaps a paradox: namely, an evolutionary revolution.In short, the decision to secede from the British Empire <i>was</i> accompanied by a truly revolutionary agenda for the infant American republic. But the most prominent leaders, John Adams chief among them, insisted on the deferral of the revolutionary agenda and, in some instances, its postponement into the distant future. Instead of regarding this gradualist approach as a moral and political failure, a conclusion that historians on the left regard as, shall we say, self-evident, the argument offered here is just the opposite. In my judgment the calculated decision to make the American Revolution happen in slow motion was a creative act of statesmanship that allowed the United States to avoid the bloody and chaotic fate of subsequent revolutionary movements in France, Russia, and China.And so, within a very strange year of full-scale war occurring alongside political reticence, we find an equally strange pattern emerging that will establish the uniquely judicious framework within which the American Revolution proceeded. John Adams, the major figure in the Continental Congress, and George Washington, the commander in chief of the Continental Army, are the chief players in this unusual story. Thomas Paine, who fits the more conventional revolutionary pattern perfectly, turns out to be the exception rather than the rule, temporarily indispensable but ultimately disposable. The great creative achievement embodied in the leadership of Adams and Washington at this propitious moment was to assure that the American Revolution moved forward, to borrow a modern phrase, with all deliberate speed.<i>HINDSIGHTS</i>When John Adams looked back from retirement on his experience thirty years earlier in the Second Continental Congress, two recollections nudged out all the other memories. The first was a bit awkward to acknowledge publicly, but since Adams believed that truth should always trump modesty (especially false modesty), he laid down his personal marker on the proceedings: &#x201c;I was incessantly employed through the Whole Fall, Winter and Spring of 1775 and 1776 during their Sittings and on Committees on mornings and Evenings,&#x201d; he recalled, &#x201c;and unquestionably did more business than any other Member of that house.&#x201d;[2]The second recollection had the effect of making the first impossible to verify. No true history of that fateful time would ever be written, Adams insisted, because the most important conversations occurred &#x201c;out of doors&#x201d; in local taverns and coffeehouses. What&#x2019;s more, the official record of the deliberations imposed a misleading gloss of coherence over the congressional proceedings, concealing the messy confusion that reigned supreme for all the delegates, himself included. Any coherent narrative of the deliberations must necessarily falsify the way it really was for all the participants, who were improvising without a script in a historical drama without a known conclusion.[3]Adams was making a serious, perhaps even a profound, point: namely, that retrospective history&#x2014;that is, history viewed with the benefit of hindsight&#x2014;is invariably neater and tidier than history as experienced by those making it. But since hindsight is the only interpretive tool historians have at their disposal, we must run the risk of deploying it here, enjoying the clairvoyance that Adams and his fellow delegates were denied in order to establish the political context of the imperial crisis that they, albeit lacking our prescient perch, were confronting in the late spring and summer of 1775.Why was there an imperial crisis? The answer of the moment was that British troops had gunned down ninety-five American patriots at Lexington and Concord. Adams was not sure whether this blood-letting would become the opening shot in a war for American independence. He was sure that it represented another escalation in what had become a twelve-year argument about the proper place of the American colonies within a reconfigured British Empire. The Adams version of that dispute was highly partisan. In effect, a corrupt British government had arbitrarily decided to impose new taxes and political restrictions on its loyal American subjects as part of a conspiratorial plot to deprive them of their traditional rights as Englishmen. The carnage at Lexington and Concord, then, was the logical and inevitable culmination of a conscious British scheme to transform loyal subjects into abject slaves.[4]Hindsight permits a more detached and ultimately ironic version of the imperial story. In 1763, as a result of its stupendous victory in the French and Indian War, Great Britain found itself a newly arrived world power with a vast empire in the eastern third of North America. Previously, British governance of their thirteen coastal colonies had been a lackadaisical affair, with royal governors largely beholden to local legislatures, which controlled the power of the purse. Enforcement of the trade regulations purportedly required by the Navigation Acts was equally blithe in spirit. Now, however, the sheer scale of its recently acquired American empire, plus the sudden recognition that governance of its expanded domain required more management than a few secretaries and clerks in Whitehall could muster, forced a major overhaul of this accidental empire into something more appropriately imperial. What looked to Adams like a sinister plot to enslave the American colonists was viewed from London as a sensible plan to make the British Empire worthy of its name.[5]There then ensued a decade of parliamentary legislation&#x2014;the Sugar Act, the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, the Coercive Acts&#x2014;all designed to fold the colonies into the empire by placing them within the authority of Parliament, which represented the collective interests of all British citizens everywhere. The colonists, of course, contested that claim, Adams leading the way by arguing that American interests were not represented in Parliament, but rather in the respective colonial legislatures, which alone could justifiably speak for American interests because they alone were duly elected to do so.[6]Knowing as we do the world-changing events about to transpire&#x2014;a seven-and-a-half-year war in which more Americans were killed or wounded proportionally than in any subsequent conflict save the Civil War, in which the British lost their entire empire in North America except for Canada&#x2014;it seems strange that such a massive movement of the historical templates could be caused by such a minor, merely constitutional, difference of opinion. In retrospect, the core problem blocking a sensible resolution was the British presumption&#x2014;fully as self-evident to them as the truths that Jefferson was soon to hurl at &#x201c;a candid world&#x201d;&#x2014;that imperial sovereignty must be singular. For George III and his chief minister, Lord North, it was akin to an axiom of political physics, a veritable Newtonian principle of political theory, that there must be one sovereign source of governance. To suggest otherwise was tantamount to arguing there was not one but many gods.If they could only have jettisoned that assumption, a workable solution to the imperial crisis was staring them right in the face. Indeed it was proposed by the First Continental Congress in 1774 and would be proposed several times again by the Second Continental Congress throughout 1775 and up to July of 1776. The solution was shared sovereignty, whereby the American colonies remained within the British Empire as loyal subjects of the Crown but retained control over their own domestic affairs. A version of this creative solution, called federalism, became the basis for the American constitutional settlement in 1787&#x2013;88. A century later the same principle became the organizing feature of the British Commonwealth. Our dalliance with hindsight, then, ends with two overlapping conclusions: first, the American Revolution was eminently avoidable; second, the imaginative failure of the British ministry in 1775&#x2013;76 constitutes perhaps the greatest blunder in the history of British statecraft.[7]<b>NOTES</b>[1] Three previous studies of this awkward year that strike me as first rate are Allen French,<i> The First Year of the American Revolution</i> (Boston, 1934); Thomas Fleming, <i>1776: Year of Illusions</i> (New York, 1975); and, more recently, David McCullough, 1776 (New York, 2005).[2] <i>AD</i> 3:355.[3] The quotation is from Adams to Benjamin Rush, 17 August 1812, in John A. Schutz and Douglass Adair, eds., <i>The Spur of Fame: Dialogues of John Adams and Benjamin Rush, 1805-1813</i> (San Marino, Calif.: 1966). I have assessed the Adams posture toward all straight-line narratives of the American Revolution in <i>Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation</i> (New York: 2001), 215-81. On Adams's role in the Continental Congress, the semifictional account by Catherine Drinker Bowen, <i>John Adams and the American Revolution</i> (Boston, 1950), still manages to capture the context most imaginatively.[4] Adams is almost a textbook example of the revolutionary mentality first identified by Bernard Bailyn in <i>Ideological Origins of the American Revolution</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 1967).[5] The first historian to insist on viewing the American Revolution from the British perspective was Lawrence H. Gipson, who summarized his multivolume account in <i>The Coming of the Revolution, 1763-1775</i> (New York, 1954). The most recent version of this imperial interpretation is Theodore Draper,<i> A Struggle for Power: The American Revolution</i> (New York, 1996).[6] On the role of the colonial assemblies, the authoritative work is Jack P. Greene, <i>The Quest for Power: The Lower Houses of Assembly in Southern Royal Colonies, 1689-1776</i> (Chapel Hill, 1963).[7] My conclusion here is harsh, but I find it inescapable. See, for example, Robert W. Tucker and David C. Hendrickson, <i>The Fall of the First British Empire</i> (Baltimore, 1982). On the British side of the story, equally derogatory, see Stanley Weintraub, <i>Iron Tears: America's Battle for Freedom, Britain's Quagmire, 1775-83</i> (New York, 2005).</p><h2>Oedipus the King (Greek Tragedy in New Translations)</h2><p>Based on the conviction that only translators who write poetry themselves can properly recreate the celebrated and timeless tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides, the <em>Greek Tragedy in New Translations</em> series offers new translations that go beyond the literal meaning of the Greek in order to evoke the sense of poetry evident in the originals. Under the editorship of Peter Burian and Alan Shaprio, each volume includes a critical introduction, commentary on difficult passages, ample stage directions, and a glossary of the mythical names and geographical references encountered in the dialogue.<br><br>Sophocles' <em>Oedipus the King</em> paves the way as the first in the series to appear in paperback. In this highly-acclaimed translation of the greatest of all Greek tragedies, Stephen Berg--the well-known poet--and Diskin Clay--the distinguished classicist--combine their talents to offer the contemporary reader a dazzling version of Sophocles' timeless work. Emphasizing the intensity of the spoken language, they capture the unrelenting power of Sophoclean drama. <br><br>No other English translation conveys the same terrifying emotional level, especially in the choral odes, the forceful descriptions of Jokasta's death, the blinding of Oedipus, and the final scene of desolation. Berg and Clay's translation--now available for the first time in paperback--both adheres strictly to the original meaning of the play and breathes new life into its language.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stephen Berg</strong> is a founder and co-editor of the <em>American Poetry Review</em> and the author of several volumes of poetry, including <em>The Daughters</em>, <em>Grief</em>, <em>Akmatova at the Black Gates</em>, and <em>In It</em>.<br><strong>Diskin Clay</strong>, Professor of Classics at Johns Hopkins University, is the author of numerous articles, translations, and reviews in classical journals.<br>Aristotle admired OEDIPUS TYRANNOS as the pinnacle of tragic art. Indeed, aside from its fine poetry and Freudian undertones, it is a taut, suspenseful detective story. It is up to King Oedipus to ferret out and purge the town of whoever murdered his predecessor. This British production is a tad too reverential and somewhat pretentious. No accommodation is made to the sightless medium, making the action hard to follow. The choral odes drone on monotonously. There's little life in the production, but there's so much life in the play that it manages to shine brightly through the chinks.

He probes the deep meaning of well-known moments in the biblical story in order to address the key question the Bible is designed to answer: Who is God?<br><br>Accessible for laypeople and important to scholars, this volume begins by exploring three key events in the Bible in which God is revealed: Jacob's dream at Bethel (the revelation of the divine presence), Moses at the burning bush (the revelation of the divine Name), and Moses on Mount Sinai (the revelation of the divine character). From there, Bauckham shows how the New Testament builds on these Old Testament passages by exploring three revelatory events in Mark's Gospel, events that reveal the Trinity: Jesus's baptism, transfiguration, and crucifixion.</p><p><b>Richard Bauckham </b>(PhD, University of Cambridge) is senior scholar at Ridley Hall, Cambridge.

Count Falier was urging his Venetian son-in-law to investigate, and preferably intervene in, the seemingly innocent plan of the Count&#x2019;s best friend, the elderly Gonzalo Rodr�guez de Tejada, to adopt a much younger man as his son. Under Italian inheritance laws this man would then be heir to Gonzalo&#x2019;s entire fortune, a prospect Gonzalo&#x2019;s friends find appalling. For his part, Brunetti wonders why the old man, a close family friend, can&#x2019;t be allowed his pleasure in peace.<br><br>And yet, what seems innocent on the Venetian surface can cause tsunamis beneath. Gonzalo unexpectedly, and literally, drops dead on the street, and one of his friends just arrived in Venice for the memorial service, is strangled in her hotel room&#x2015;having earlier sent Gonzalo an email saying &#x201c;We are the only ones who know you cannot do this,&#x201d; referring to the adoption.

An announcement beamed around the world, highlighted in virtually all major newspapers, trumpeted that the first draft of the human genome, our own instruction book, had been assembled.</p><p>The human genome consists of all the DNA of our species, the hereditary code of life. This newly revealed text was 3 billion letters long, and written in a strange and cryptographic four-letter code. Such is the amazing complexity of the information carried within each cell of the human body, that a live reading of that code at a rate of one letter per second would take thirty-one years, even if reading continued day and night. Printing these letters out in regular font size on normal bond paper and binding them all together would result in a tower the height of the Washington Monument. For the first time on that summer morning this amazing script, carrying within it all of the instructions for building a human being, was available to the world.</p><p>As the leader of the international Human Genome Project, which had labored mightily over more than a decade to reveal this DNA sequence, I stood beside President Bill Clinton in the East Room of the White House, along with Craig Venter, the leader of a competing private sector enterprise. Prime Minister Tony Blair was connected to the event by satellite, and celebrations were occurring simultaneously in many parts of the world.</p><p>Clinton's speech began by comparing this human sequence map to the map that Meriwether Lewis had unfolded in front of President Thomas Jefferson in that very room nearly two hundred years earlier. Clinton said, "Without a doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced by humankind." But the part of his speech that most attracted public attention jumped from the scientific perspective to the spiritual. "Today," he said, "we are learning the language in which God created life. We are gaining ever more awe for the complexity, the beauty, and the wonder of God's most divine and sacred gift."</p><p>Was I, a rigorously trained scientist, taken aback at such a blatantly religious reference by the leader of the free world at a moment such as this? Was I tempted to scowl or look at the floor in embarrassment? No, not at all. In fact I had worked closely with the president's speechwriter in the frantic days just prior to this announcement, and had strongly endorsed the inclusion of this paragraph. When it came time for me to add a few words of my own, I echoed this sentiment: "It's a happy day for the world. It is humbling for me, and awe-inspiring, to realize that we have caught the first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to God."</p><p>What was going on here? Why would a president and a scientist, charged with announcing a milestone in biology and medicine, feel compelled to invoke a connection with God? Aren't the scientific and spiritual worldviews antithetical, or shouldn't they at least avoid appearing in the East Room together? What were the reasons for invoking God in these two speeches? Was this poetry? Hypocrisy? A cynical attempt to curry favor from believers, or to disarm those who might criticize this study of the human genome as reducing humankind to machinery? No. Not for me. Quite the contrary, for me the experience of sequencing the human genome, and uncovering this most remarkable of all texts, was both a stunning scientific achievement and an occasion of worship.</p><p>Many will be puzzled by these sentiments, assuming that a rigorous scientist could not also be a serious believer in a transcendent God. This book aims to dispel that notion, by arguing that belief in God can be an entirely rational choice, and that the principles of faith are, in fact, complementary with the principles of science.</p><p>This potential synthesis of the scientific and spiritual worldviews is assumed by many in modern times to be an impossibility, rather like trying to force the two poles of a magnet together into the same spot. Despite that impression, however, many Americans seem interested in incorporating the validity of both of these worldviews into their daily lives. Recent polls confirm that 93 percent of Americans profess some form of belief in God; yet most of them also drive cars, use electricity, and pay attention to weather reports, apparently assuming that the science undergirding these phenomena is generally trustworthy.</p><p>And what about spiritual belief amongst scientists? This is actually more prevalent than many realize. In 1916, researchers asked biologists, physicists, and mathematicians whether they believed in a God who actively communicates with humankind and to whom one may pray in expectation of receiving an answer. About 40 percent answered in the affirmative. In 1997, the same survey was repeated verbatim -- and to the surprise of the researchers, the percentage remained very nearly the same.</p><p>So perhaps the "battle" between science and religion is not as polarized as it seems? Unfortunately, the evidence of potential harmony is often overshadowed by the high-decibel pronouncements of those who occupy the poles of the debate. Bombs are definitely being thrown from both sides. For example, essentially discrediting the spiritual beliefs of 40 percent of his colleagues as sentimental nonsense, the prominent evolutionist Richard Dawkins has emerged as the leading spokesperson for the point of view that a belief in evolution demands atheism. Among his many eye-popping statements: "Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.... Faith, being belief that isn't based on evidence, is the principal vice of any religion."</p><p>On the other side, certain religious fundamentalists attack science as dangerous and untrustworthy, and point to a literal interpretation of sacred texts as the only reliable means of discerning scientific truth. Among this community, comments from the late Henry Morris, a leader of the creationist movement, stand out: "Evolution's lie permeates and dominates modern thought in every field. That being the case, it follows inevitably that evolutionary thought is basically responsible for the lethally ominous political developments, and the chaotic moral and social disintegrations that have been accelerating everywhere....When science and the Bible differ, science has obviously misinterpreted its data."</p><p>This rising cacophony of antagonistic voices leaves many sincere observers confused and disheartened. Reasonable people conclude that they are forced to choose between these two unappetizing extremes, neither of which offers much comfort. Disillusioned by the stridency of both perspectives, many choose to reject both the trustworthiness of scientific conclusions and the value of organized religion, slipping instead into various forms of antiscientific thinking, shallow spirituality, or simple apathy. Others decide to accept the value of both science and spirit, but compartmentalize these parts of their spiritual and material existence to avoid any uneasiness about apparent conflicts. Along these lines, the late biologist Stephen Jay Gould advocated that science and faith should occupy separate, "non-overlapping magisteria." But this, too, is potentially unsatisfying. It inspires internal conflict, and deprives people of the chance to embrace either science or spirit in a fully realized way.</p><p>So here is the central question of this book: In this modern era of cosmology, evolution, and the human genome, is there still the possibility of a richly satisfying harmony between the scientific and spiritual worldviews? I answer with a resounding yes! In my view, there is no conflict in being a rigorous scientist and a person who believes in a God who takes a personal interest in each one of us. Science's domain is to explore nature. God's domain is in the spiritual world, a realm not possible to explore with the tools and language of science. It must be examined with the heart, the mind, and the soul -- and the mind must find a way to embrace both realms.</p><p>I will argue that these perspectives not only can coexist within one person, but can do so in a fashion that enriches and enlightens the human experience. Science is the only reliable way to understand the natural world, and its tools when properly utilized can generate profound insights into material existence. But science is powerless to answer questions such as "Why did the universe come into being?" "What is the meaning of human existence?" "What happens after we die?" One of the strongest motivations of humankind is to seek answers to profound questions, and we need to bring all the power of both the scientific and spiritual perspectives to bear on understanding what is both seen and unseen. The goal of this book is to explore a pathway toward a sober and intellectually honest integration of these views.</p><p>The consideration of such weighty matters can be unsettling. Whether we call it by name or not, all of us have arrived at a certain worldview. It helps us make sense of the world around us, provides us with an ethical framework, and guides our decisions about the future. Anyone who tinkers with that worldview should not do it lightly. A book that proposes to challenge something so fundamental may inspire more uneasiness than comfort. But we humans seem to possess a deep-seated longing to find the truth, even though that longing is easily suppressed by the mundane details of daily life. Those distractions combine with a desire to avoid considering our own mortality, so that days, weeks, months, or even years can easily pass where no serious consideration is given to the eternal questions of human existence. This book is only a small antidote to that circumstance, but will perhaps provide an opportunity for self-reflection, and a desire to look deeper.</p><p>First, I should explain how a scientist who studies genetics came to be a believer in a God who is unlimited by time and space, and who takes personal interest in human bei...</p></p><h2>100 Scientists Who Made History (DK 100 Things That Made History)</h2><p><b>Through the life stories of scientists and innovators like Leonardo da Vinci, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, and more, STEAM concepts come to life engaging readers of all ages.</b><br><br>Full of the true-life stories of scientists and innovators who have shaped our society and how we see the world around us, this book puts major scientific discoveries into context.

And it is said that somewhere on the edge of what was known and unknown, a man and a woman paused in their struggles to survive and faced each other. One asked the other, "Is there more to this than hauling wood?" The older of the two sighed, "Yes . . . and no."<br><br>This may have been the beginning of our sense of being and our search for meaning. I imagine these two faced everything we face. For the journey is the same: how to open our pain and listen to all that matters, so we can make it through and rejoice from day to day.<br><br>Like those before us, we have the chance to wake and love, the chance to welcome the gift of surprise and befriend the Whole. For beneath the life of problem-solving waits the struggle to be real, from which no one is exempt. We each are asked to make our way through the drama of our bleeding to the stripping of our will, through the tensions of our suffering to the humility of surrender where we might learn the ordinary art of living at the pace of what is real.<br><br>So, is there more to this than hauling the wood of our history around? More than just replaying our patterns? Whether yesterday or five thousand years ago, there has always been the need to break our habits in the world&#x2014;the need to give up what no longer works.<br><br>Ultimately, there is always the need to risk being new. Yet even succeeding, to be authentic&#x2014;living as close to our experience as possible&#x2014;is arduous. For being human, we remember and forget. We stray and return, fall down and get up, and cling and let go, again and again. But it is this straying and returning that makes life interesting, this clinging and letting go&#x2014;damned as it is&#x2014;that exercises the heart.<br><br>They say that, after a time, the two who paused on the edge of what was known and unknown stumbled into humility. "Please, tell me, is there more to this than hauling wood?" the one would ask again. And the more tired of the two replied, "No, no. It is all in the hauling, all in the wood, all in how we face each other around the small fires we can build."<br><br>It was then that they rested, as we rest, when accepting the grace of our humanness. You see, we've always been on a journey, like it or not, aware of it or not, struggling to enter and embrace things as they are. And when we can accept our small part in the way of things, when we can build a small fire and gather, it opens us to joy. So join me on this journey we are already on. We can help each other hold nothing back. We can help each other live a sincere life. We can help each other wear down what gets in the way, waking close to the bone.<br><br>Come. There are teachers everywhere: in the stories around us, in the stories within us, in the life of expression that sings where we are broken, in the kinship of gratitude that keeps reminding us that we need each other as we become the earth.<br><b>MOVEMENT 1: There Are Teachers Everywhere</b><br><br>LISTENING TO THE VOICE INSIDE<br><br>If I dare to hear you, I will feel you like the sun and grow in your direction.<br><br>I remember the first time I was forced to listen, not by adults or teachers, but by running as a boy in the playground so fast and free that I fell and scraped my knee. After the cut reduced to a throb, I couldn't get up. It was then that I saw my blood sprinkled in the dirt. It was then I first realized that this great thing we ran on was the earth. I had never paid attention to it. I was just a boy. I put my ear to the ground and listened. I don't know what I thought I would hear. But it was summer and the ground was warm. So I thought I heard warmth. I told my teacher, but she said you can't hear warmth. Yet some forty-five years later, I think you can. Whenever you put your ear to the earth or to your own heart, the deeper instruments play, swelling our sense of things. When lost, we simply have to remember to put our ear to the earth, or to our heart, and we will hear a warmth that guides.<br><br>The next time, I was more drawn to listen than forced. It was a few years later on my father's sailboat, which was the oasis of my youth. It was a thirty-foot ketch that he'd built. Once out to sea, I remember being pulled forward by the water till the family noises faded. I found myself sitting in the bow of the boat, legs over the side, staring into the endless waves parting around us. I didn't have the words or concepts for it, but it felt like God's voice murmuring in the waves. This was my first experience of solitude.<br><br>At a very early age, both the earth and the sea opened me to something deep inside that has carried me ever since. It was years before I had names for any of this, and after years of study in many spiritual traditions, I believe it is the simple, mysterious pulse of what is sacred.<br><br>In these small childhood experiences of listening, I discovered a spiritual law: that we are both forced and drawn by everything larger than us to hear what is essential. Repeatedly, we are given chance after chance to stop and listen to all that is fundamental. When forced to our knees, we are offered the chance to hear the warmth in all that holds us up. When drawn into the rhythms of vastness that surround us, we are offered the chance to hear the waves of God's voice, of which we are one, if we can leave the noise of others behind.<br><br>When we can listen deeply, we are strengthened to feel that everything around us lives within us and that everything within us lives as part of the world. When we experience both the circumference and center of the circle of life at once, we are then in the larger Self, the Universal Self, as Carl Jung describes it.<br><br>Imagine a nineteen-year-old in the chaos of war, running through mud and explosions, seeing others fall around him. Imagine him slipping into a ditch, a small pocket of stillness that seems out of reach, for the moment, from all the destruction. And in that small empty space between the mud and his frightened mouth, he is forced to listen to his breath. In that small cloud emitting from his lungs, he is forced to hear the breath of everything that ever lived. The conflicts change and the ditches change, but sometimes listening to that small breath is all we have. And sometimes it opens up everything.<br><br>This falling down and emptying ourselves of noise so that we can hear the sacred pulse of things is at the heart of all the meditation practices invoked throughout the ages. Sooner or later, if we want to feel what it is to be alive in a Universe that is alive, we will have to empty ourselves, open our hearts, and listen. This emptying and opening and listening is the practice that allows us to hear that voice of God (whatever name you give to it) that resides in each of us. By listening with all of who we are, we are briefly illuminated, like stained glass; letting everything move through us in those privileged and enlightened moments.<br><br>But how do we listen? It is so simple and so hard. So obvious to begin and so elusive to maintain. In this lies the vitality of deep listening. To keep beginning. Over and over. To keep emptying and opening. And simply to keep listening. For to listen is to continually give up all expectation and to give our attention, completely and freshly, to what is before us, not really knowing what we will hear or what that will mean. In the practice of our days, to listen is to lean in, softly, with a willingness to be changed by what we hear.<br><br>Over the years, I have been opened to a deeper listening when called to sit with the dying. In the sacred air between us, I have heard the weight of things fall away, have seen ancient hands that held me as a boy search for something that has always been near, have wondered what hundred-year-old eyes see with their last look.<br><br>I remember my grandmother at ninety-four staring into some holy place I couldn't see. It was the moment after I'd left. I had turned back for one more taste of her. She didn't know I was there, and I saw her as devoutly amazed as any reluctant prophet. Somewhere between the bedpan and her dirty window, eternity was singing. I'll never forget her face.<br><br>It seems that those pared down to only what is essential peer into the one untranslatable place, the sweet place that no one can speak of. And when waking on the edge of life or death, when pressed to be fully here, we peer into a truth that changes everything. Then, if still here, we come back with our hearts seared anew by that seeing. If blessed, we come back to live in days that say so sweetly that everything, even dust, is beautifully ordinary and irreplaceable.<br><br>We can't seek out such wakefulness. In truth, it happens to us. But we can ready ourselves for such privileged moments. We can, if present enough, listen to each day the way we would listen to those who are dying. We can keep beginning, keep emptying, keep breathing ourselves open.</p><h2>The Emerald Tablet of Hermes</h2><p>The Emerald Tablet is a cryptic piece of the Hermetica reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia and its transmutation. It was highly regarded by medieval alchemists as the foundation of their art and its Hermetic tradition. The original source of the Emerald Tablet is unknown. Although Hermes Trismegistus is the author named in the text, the text was first translated into Latin in the twelfth century. Numerous translations, interpretations and commentaries followed.</p><p>Hermes Trismegistus</p><h2>View From Above: An Astronaut Photographs the World</h2><p>A NASA astronaut and distinguished space photographer who spent more than seven months off the planet presents the infinite wonder of his astonishing aerial images of Earth, along with captivating tales of life at the edge of the atmosphere.<br>&nbsp;<br>Astounding photographs of our world from outer space and edge-of-your-seat stories of survival in orbit--including close collegiality with Russian cosmonauts--make this a dazzling, personal account of living on the space shuttle. Few people get the experience of seeing the world from outer space--and no one has taken as many pictures of Earth from above as Terry Virts.

In the pages that follow we will explore the transforming power of the gospel from several angles. Part One focuses on the foundations for personal change. We will look at God s ultimate goal in transforming us (Chapter One); the key to transformation, which is the gospel itself (Chapter Two); and the application of the gospel to our lives in three specific ways (Chapters Three, Four, and Five). Part Two then takes up the pattern of personal change. We will explore the captivating beauty of gospel holiness (Chapter Six); with its demands that we both kill sin (Chapter Seven); and grow in grace by the power of the Spirit (Chapter Eight); and the quest for joy that motivates us in this pursuit and strengthens us in the battle for holiness (Chapter Nine). Part Three of the book focuses on the means of personal change, the tools God uses to transform us. These final three chapters, while building on the foundation of the gospel discussed earlier in the book, are the most practical. We will learn how God uses spiritual disciplines (Chapter Ten); suffering (Chapter Eleven); and personal relationships in the body of Christ (Chapter Twelve) to conform us to the image of Christ. In each of these chapters, my aim has been to connect the dots between the gospel, the goal of Christlikeness, and the specific aspect of spirituality under discussion.</p><p>"Brian Hedges brings a beautiful clarity to our understanding of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and pulls together a comprehensive patchwork of the Gospel's implications for everyday life.

Papa Bear is searching for Little Bear, who has escaped the den. Little Bear is following a bee, because where there are bees, there is honey! When the quest leads both bears into the bustling city and a humming opera house, theatrical hijinks ensue, culminating in a deliciously harmonious reunion. Children and parents alike will savor Benjamin Chaud's lush illustrations, and relish in the book's bonus seek-and-find elements.<br><br><b>Looking for more Papa Bear and Little Bear? Check out Bear's Sea Escape!</b></p><p>Benjamin Chaud is a well-known French author and illustrator whose work includes picture books and a CD for children. He lives in the Southeast of France.*Starred Review* This visual treat of a book follows Papa Bear and Little Bear on an adventure from the countryside to a bustling city. Papa Bear is hibernating in the forest, toes up and round belly on full display. Little Bear, however, is too caught up in honey thoughts to worry about winter approaching, and a sort of buzzing beckons him out of the forest. He&#x2019;s hot on the heels of a bee. Call it intuition, but Papa Bear wakes suddenly wondering where his little cub has scampered off to and he sets off at a trot through the forest. This is the premise, and it&#x2019;s simple enough, right? But no&#x2014;French author and illustrator Chaud wends us through intricate scenes, first populated with all kinds of animals and trees, then cityscapes filled with people, so bustling and charmingly detailed that the eye, happily, doesn&#x2019;t know where to land first. It&#x2019;s Where&#x2019;s Waldo?, Little Bear&#x2013;style. Chaud, however, knows when to pause for effect, as during Papa Bear&#x2019;s rousing solo at the Opera House, where Little Bear has arrived. The pictures really do tell the story here; the words seem almost unnecessary. With a distinctive art style, large vertical trim size, and expressive characters&#x2014;from bear to opera-goer&#x2014;this is a book not to be missed. Encore! Preschool-Kindergarten. --Ann Kelley</p><h2>Pacific Crest Trials: A Psychological and Emotional Guide to Successfully Thru-Hiking the Pacific Crest Trail</h2><p><b>Thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is 90% mental</b>.<p></p> Each year, thousands of backpackers&nbsp;take to the Pacific Crest Trail with the <em>intention</em> of successfully thru-hiking the 2,650-mile footpath that extends from&nbsp;Mexico to&nbsp;Canada.

Join renowned leprosy surgeon Dr. Paul Brand and bestselling writer Philip Yancey on a remarkable journey through inner space&#x2015;a spellbinding account of medical intervention, pain and healing, and the courage of humanity. Discover here the eternal truths revealed by our seemingly ordinary existence. The human body is a window into the very structure of God's creation and a testament to God's glory.</p><p>Dr. Paul Brand (1914&#x2013;2003) grew up in India, studied medicine in London, and practiced orthopedic surgery in India and the United States. He achieved world renown for his innovative techniques in the treatment of leprosy. He wrote <em>Clinical Mechanics of the Hand</em>, still considered a classic in the field of hand surgery, as well as <em>The Gift of Pain</em> (coauthored with Philip Yancey) and <em>God's Forever Feast</em>. Before his death in 2003, he received many honors, including the prestigious Albert Lasker Award and appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire.<br><br>Philip Yancey has written twenty-five books. Early on he crafted best-selling books such as <em>Disappointment with God</em> and <em>Where Is God When It Hurts?</em> while also editing <em>The Student Bible</em>. More recently, he has explored central issues of the Christian faith, penning award-winning titles such as <em>The Jesus I Never Knew</em>, <em>What's So Amazing About Grace?</em>, and <em>Prayer: Does It Make Any Difference?</em> Yancey's books have garnered thirteen Gold Medallion Awards from Christian publishers and booksellers. He currently has more than fifteen million books in print, published in over forty languages worldwide. Yancey worked as a journalist in Chicago for some twenty years, editing the youth magazine <em>Campus Life</em> while also writing for a wide variety of magazines including <em>Reader's Digest</em>, <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>, <em>National Wildlife</em>, and <em>Christianity Today</em>. In 1992 he and his wife, Janet, moved to the foothills of Colorado where they live now."I have long loved the collaboration between the marvelous theologian Philip Yancey and his mentor&#x2015;orthopedic, humanitarian surgeon Paul Brand. What a blessing to reread this work after thirty years, to immerse myself in the story of Dr. Brand's work with leprosy patients in India and the Bayou, and in the resultant lessons about the miraculous workings of the human body, the beauty of human friendship and caring, the profundity of God's love. Brilliant, charming, and wonder inducing, this is a modern classic of science and faith." (Anne Lamott, author of Traveling Mercies, Bird by Bird, and Hallelujah Anyway)<br><br>"God's imaginative genius with his physical creation always has astounding parallels in the spiritual realm, and it's no different with the epitome of his creation, the human body. In their timeless Christian classic <em>Fearfully and Wonderfully</em>, my friend Philip and his coauthor Dr. Brand draw amazing parallels between our bodies and the Body of Christ that leave the reader startled and breathless with wonder. This remarkable book had a profound impact on my life when I first read it years ago, and its insights will astonish you for sure!" (Joni Eareckson Tada, Joni and Friends International Disability Center)<br><br>"This book is a testimony to the peculiar mystery of God's presence&#x2015;the Word made flesh, as John's Gospel names it. For people whose spiritual lives have been too disembodied, Dr. Brand's attention to living bodies invites us to return to our true selves. At the same time, Yancey has rendered enfleshened truth about our existence in words. I pray you can receive this combination of wisdom and craft as the gift that it is&#x2015;a word in season, inviting each of us deeper into the life that is really life." (Jonathan Wilson-Hartgrove, author of Reconstructing the Gospel)<br><br>"I have greatly appreciated my friend Philip Yancey's work over the years. I enthusiastically commend this book in which Philip offers his wisdom and the wisdom of Dr. Paul Brand to a new generation of readers. I anticipate that it will be of great value to Christians and non-Christians alike." (John M. Perkins, cofounder, Christian Community Development Association, president emeritus of the John Perkins Foundation)<br><br>"This is a stunning, wondrous book by two of my favorite people. I remember reading Phil Yancey in India, as I lived in a village of folks who had leprosy, which is also where I heard about Dr. Brand. Mother Teresa used to say that in the poor we can see Jesus 'in his most distressing disguises.' This book unpacks what that means and invites every one of us to marvel at the image of God in every person. Dr. Brand is a legendary medical doctor, and Philip is a doctor of the soul. Together they have written one of the greatest books on life . . . in a world where far too many lives are disgraced and desecrated. May it make you a champion of life, just as both of these men have been, and may we be death's greatest adversary." (Shane Claiborne, cofounder of The Simple Way and Red Letter Christians, author of Beating Guns)<br><br>"In a world divided by races and faces, healers Philip Yancey and Paul Brand knit us together by blazing a magnificent journey through the human body&#x2015;inspiring discovery, cell by cell, of God's marvel of a blueprint for his unified church. A shining collaboration, their book validates well that if every cell matters, so does every life. Yet only in relation to each other do we come alive. In proving that view, Yancey and Brand achieve an uplifting and awakening balm for today's bruised and fraying church. This book is a glorious achievement, and it arrives kindly with soothing correction. But best of all, it's right on time."

Forgeng&#x2019;s translation of Joachim Meyer&#x2019;s The Art of Sword Combat the author was alerted to an earlier recension of the work which was discovered in Lund University Library in Sweden. <br><br>The manuscript, produced in Strassburg around 1568, is illustrated with thirty watercolor images and seven ink diagrams. <br><br>The text covers combat with the long sword (hand-and-a-half sword), dusack (a one-handed practice weapon comparable to a saber), and rapier. The manuscript&#x2019;s theoretical discussion of guards is one of the most critical passages to understanding this key feature of the historical practice, not just in relation to Meyer but in relation to the medieval combat systems in general.<br><br>The manuscript offers an extensive repertoire of training drills for both the dusack and the rapier, a feature largely lacking in treatises of the period as a whole but critical to modern reconstructions of the practice. The translation also includes a biography of Meyer, much of which has only recently come to light, as well as technical terminology, and other essential information for understanding and contextualizing the work.</p><p>Joachim Meyer was born in Basel in Switzerland in approximately 1537, possibly the son of Jacob Meyer, a stationer, and Anna Freund. He became a burgher of Strasbourg by marrying a widow in 1560, most likely during his apprenticeship as a cutler. He made a living as both a cutler and a professional fencer until 1570, in which year he published his Art of Combat &#x2013; the book that made him famous. The making of this book, however, left him deeply indebted, and the search for potential buyers led him to leave Strasbourg and work as a Master-of-Arms at the court of the Duke of Schwerin. Unfortunately, he died shortly after his arrival, on 24 February 1571, at the age of just thirty-four, leaving the burden of his debt to his widow and brother-in-law.<br><br>Jeffrey L Forgeng is curator of the Worcester Art Museum&#x2019;s Higgins Collection, the second largest collection of arms and armor in the Americas, and also teaches as Adjunct Professor of History at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.

The still-fragile New Republic, rocked by internal conflict, now faces a potentially overwhelming challenge from beyond the known galaxy: the Yuuzhan Vong, a sinister race of warriors using highly advanced (and creepy) organic "devices" and vehicles, whose immense strength and technological edge lets them fight toe to toe with Jedi. And who better to flesh out these powerful and malevolent aliens, so dismissive and disdainful of humanity, than R.A. Salvatore, the author who almost single-handedly popularized Dungeons and Dragons' equally awful bad guys, the Drow, with his Drizzt Do'Urden books. <p> In kicking off Del Rey's five-year <i>New Jedi Order</i> story arc, Salvatore must endure the predictable hazing of any new <i>Star Wars</i> author.

According to world-renowned game designer Jane McGonigal, the reason for this mass exodus to virtual worlds is that videogames are increasingly fulfilling genuine human needs. In this groundbreaking exploration of the power and future of gaming, McGonigal reveals how we can use the lessons of game design to fix what is wrong with the real world. <br><br> Drawing on positive psychology, cognitive science, and sociology, <em>Reality Is Broken</em> uncovers how game designers have hit on core truths about what makes us happy and utilized these discoveriesto astonishing effect in virtual environments. Videogames consistently provide the exhilarating rewards, stimulating challenges, and epic victories that are so often lacking in the real world. But why, McGonigal asks, should we use the power of games for escapist entertainment alone? Her research suggests that gamers are expert problem solvers and collaborators because they regularly cooperate with other players to overcome daunting virtual challenges, and she helped pioneer a fast-growing genre of games that aims to turn gameplay to socially positive ends. <br><br> In <em>Reality Is Broken</em>, she reveals how these new alternate reality games are already improving the quality of our daily lives, fighting social problems such as depression and obesity, and addressing vital twenty-first-century challenges-and she forecasts the thrilling possibilities that lie ahead. She introduces us to games like World Without Oil, a simulation designed to brainstorm-and therefore avert- the challenges of a worldwide oil shortage, and Evoke, a game commissioned by the World Bank Institute that sends players on missions to address issues from poverty to climate change. <br><br> McGonigal persuasively argues that those who continue to dismiss games will be at a major disadvantage in the coming years. Gamers, on the other hand, will be able to leverage the collaborative and motivational power of games in their own lives, communities, and businesses. Written for gamers and nongamers alike, <em>Reality Is Broken</em> shows us that the future will belong to those who can understand, design, and play games.</p><p><strong>Practical Advice for Gamers by Jane McGonigal</strong> <p></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Reality is Broken</em> explains the science behind why games are good for us--why they make us happier, more creative, more resilient, and better able to lead others in world-changing efforts.</p> <p>But some games are better for us than others, and there is too much of a good thing.</p> <p>Here are a few secrets that aren&#x2019;t in the book to help you (or the gamer in your life) get the most positive impact from playing games.</p> <p>This practical advice--5 key quidelines, plus 2 quick rules--is scientifically backed, and it can be summed up in a single sentence:</p> <p><em>Play games you enjoy no more than 21 hours a week; face-to-face with friends and family as often as you can; and in co-operative or creator modes whenever possible. </em></p> <p><strong>1. Don&#x2019;t play more than 21 hours a week.</strong></p> <p>Studies show that games benefit us mentally and emotionally when we play up to 3 hours a day, or 21 hours a week. (In extremely stressful circumstances--such as serving in the military during war-time--research shows that gamers can benefit from as many as 28 hours a week.) But for virtually everyone else, whenever you play more than 21 hours a week, the benefits of gaming start to decline sharply. By the time you&#x2019;re spending 40 hours or more a week playing games, the psychological benefits of playing games have disappeared entirely--and are replaced with negative impacts on your physical health, relationships, and real-life goals. So always strive to keep your gaming in the sweet spot: 7&#x2013;21 hours a week.</p> <p><strong>2. Playing with real-life friends and family is better than playing alone all the time, or with strangers. </strong></p> <p>Gaming strengthens your social bonds and builds trust, two key factors in any positive relationship. And the more positive relationships you have in real life, the happier, healthier and more successful you are.</p> <p>You can get mental and emotional benefits from single-player games, or by playing with strangers online--but to really unlock the power of games, it&#x2019;s important to play them with people you really know and like as often as possible.</p> <p>A handy rule-of-thumb: try to make half of your gaming social. If you play 10 hours a week, try to play face-to-face with real-life friends or family for at least 5 of those hours.</p> <p>(And if you&#x2019;re not a gamer yourself--but you have a family member who plays games all the time, it would do you both good to play together--even if you think you don&#x2019;t like games!)</p> <p><strong>3. Playing face-to-face with friends and family beats playing with them online. </strong></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re in the same physical space, you&#x2019;ll supercharge both the positive emotional impacts and the social bonding.</p> <p>Many of the benefits of games are derived from the way they make us feel--and all positive emotions are heightened by face-to-face interaction.</p> <p>Plus, research shows that social ties are strengthened much more when we play games in the same room than when we play games together online.</p> <p>Multi-player games are great for this. But single-player works too! You can get all the same benefits by taking turns at a single-player game, helping and cheering each other on.</p> <p><strong>4. Cooperative gameplay, overall, has more benefits than competitive gameplay. </strong></p> <p>Studies show that cooperative gameplay lifts our mood longer, and strengthens our friendships more, than competing against each other.</p> <p>Cooperative gameplay also makes us more likely to help someone in real life, and better collaborators at work--boosting our real-world likeability and chances for success.</p> <p>Competition has its place, too, of course--we learn to trust others more when we compete against them. But if we spend all our time competing with others, we miss out on the special benefits of co-op play. So when you&#x2019;re gaming with others, be sure to check to see if there are co-op missions or a co-op mode available. An hour of co-op a week goes a long way. (Find great co-op games for every platform, and a family-friendly list too, at Co-Optimus, the best online resource for co-op gaming.)</p> <p><strong>5. Creative games have special positive impacts. </strong></p> <p>Many games encourage or even require players to design and create as part of the gameplay process--for example: Spore, Little Big Planet, and Minecraft; the Halo level designer and the Guitar Hero song creator. These games have been shown to build up players&#x2019; sense of creative agency--and they make us more likely to create something outside of the game. If you want to really build up your own creative powers, creative games are a great place to start.</p> <p>Of course, you can always take the next creative step--and start making your own games. If you&#x2019;ve never made a game, it&#x2019;s easier than you think--and there are some great books to help you get started.</p> <p><strong>2 Other Important Rules:</strong></p> <p><em>* You can get all of the benefits of a good game without realistic violence--you (or your kids) don&#x2019;t have to play games with guns or gore. </em></p> <p>If you feel strongly about violence, look to games in other genres--there&#x2019;s no shortage of amazing sports, music, racing, puzzle, role-playing, casual, strategy and adventure games.</p> <p><em>*Any game that makes you feel bad is no longer a good game for you to play. </em></p> <p>This should be obvious, but sometimes we get so caught up in our games that we forget they&#x2019;re supposed to be fun.</p> <p>If you find yourself feeling really upset when you lose a game, or if you&#x2019;re fighting with friends or strangers when you play--you&#x2019;re too invested. Switch to a different game for a while, a game that has &#x201c;lower stakes&#x201d; for you personally.</p> <p>Or, especially if you play with strangers online, you might find yourself surrounded by other players who say things that make you uncomfortable--or who just generally act like jerks. Their behavior will actually make it harder for you to get the positive benefits of games--so don&#x2019;t waste your time playing with a community that gets you down.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you start to wonder if you&#x2019;re spending too much time on a particular game &#x2013; maybe you&#x2019;re starting to feel just a tiny bit addicted--keep track of your gaming hours for one week. Make sure they add up to less than 21 hours! And you may want to limit yourself to even fewer for a little while if you&#x2019;re feeling too much &#x201c;gamer regret.&#x201d;</p>World-renowned game designer and futurist Jane McGonigal, PhD. takes play seriously.

Supernatural, horror, noir, science fiction, fantasy, pulp, and more: all were equally at home in his wondrous mind. These are stories where lions stalk the plains, classic cars rove the streets, and spacecraft hover just overhead. Here roam musicians, magicians, vampires, monsters, toreros, extraterrestrials, androids, and perhaps even the Devil himself. With dizzying feats of master storytelling and joyously eccentric humor, Beaumont transformed his nightmares and reveries into impeccably crafted stories that leave themselves indelibly stamped upon the walls of the mind. In Beaumont&#x2019;s hands, nothing is impossible: it all seems plausible, even likely.<br><br>"[Beaumont&#x2019;s] imagination, as&nbsp;<i>Perchance to Dream</i>&nbsp;amply shows, was more than most writers enjoy in the longest of lifetimes."&nbsp;<b><i>-NPR</i></b><br><br>For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

The Hidden Art of Disney's Mid-Century Era: The 1950s took my breath away...Ghez features a wealth of work that was too weird, too ambitious, too esoteric to make it into a Disney production -- it's a tour of a parallel universe in which Disney was the world's best-funded avant garde salon, where incredibly talented, fiercely driven painters and illustrators produced challenging work of enormous wit, drive, and ambition."<br>-Cory Doctorow, <i>BoingBoing</i><br><br><b>4 out of 5 stars</b> "What draws us in most about this book is, of course, the art, but also Didier's warts-and-all insights.

Many will be drawn to the story of Mary Blair, a female artist who exceeded in a male-dominated field, as she was one of the favorites of Disney himself. It's not hard to see why; her designs for 'Alice in Wonderland' are armed with color that seems as if it came directly from your dreams. One piece - which graces the book's cover - features Alice sitting before a seemingly never-ending ocean blue table, complete with all manner of multicolored teapots, cups and chairs, with a dark background featuring little beyond a couple bare trees, invoking a sense of mystery and dread behind the bright colors in the foreground. In other words, it perfectly captures the wonder and hints of dread that would come in the film."<br>-<i>The Auburn Citizen</i><br><br>"... these books are a treasure trove of art that the samples included here only touch on.

And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print".

This vast parade often goes unnoticed, except in a few places where these small travelers concentrate in large numbers. One such place is along Lake Erie in northwestern Ohio. There, the peak of spring migration is so spectacular that it attracts bird watchers from around the globe, culminating in one of the world&#x2019;s biggest birding festivals.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Millions of winged migrants pass through the region, some traveling thousands of miles, performing epic feats of endurance and navigating with stunning accuracy. Now climate change threatens to disrupt patterns of migration and the delicate balance between birds, seasons, and habitats. But wind farms&#x2014;popular as green energy sources&#x2014;can be disastrous for birds if built in the wrong places.

Scott Fitzgerald and Pablo Picasso until tragedy struck their children at the end of the Roaring Twenties</p><p>Gerald and Sara Murphy were the golden couple of the Lost Generation. Born to wealth and privilege, they fled the stuffy confines of upper-class America to reinvent themselves in France as legendary party givers and enthusiastic participants in the modernist revolution of the 1920s. He became an important painter; she made everyday life a work of art. Their friends F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and John Dos Passos all based fictional characters on the Murphys; Picasso painted them; and Calvin Tomkins rekindled their glamour for a younger generation in his affectionate 1971 portrait, <i>Living Well Is the Best Revenge</i>. Amanda Vaill's vivid new biography builds on Tomkins's work to provide a full-length account of the Murphys' remarkable life together.<p> As well as good times, that life included suffering endured with great courage. The Murphys' teenage sons died within two years of each other in the mid-1930s--one suddenly, one after a long battle with tuberculosis--and the Depression forced Gerald to resume the uncongenial work of managing his family's business. Vaill's sensitive rendering reveals the moral substance that enabled this stylish couple to survive heartbreak. But it's her marvelous evocation of those magical expatriate years that lingers in the memory. The wit and imaginative panache with which the Murphys lived sparkles again, recapturing a splendid historical moment. As Sara later said, "It was like a great fair, and everybody was so young." <i>--Wendy Smith</i></p>Gifted artist Gerald Murphy and his elegant wife, Sara, were icons of the most enchanting period of our time; handsome, talented, and wealthy expatriate Americans, they were at the very center of the literary scene in Paris in the 1920s. In Everybody Was So Young--one of the best reviewed books of 1995--Amanda Vaill brilliantly portrays both the times in which the Murphys lived and the fascinating friends who flocked around them. Whether summering with Picasso on the French Riviera or watching bullfights with Hemingway in Pamplona, Gerald and Sara inspired kindred creative spirits like Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, and F. Scott Fitzgerald (Nicole and Dick Diver in Tender is the Night were modeled after the Murphys). Their story is both glittering and tragic, and in this sweeping and richly anecdotal portrait of a marriage and an era, Amanda Vaill &#34;has brought them to life as never before&#34; (&#34;Chicago Tribune).</p><h2>Mindfulness and Acceptance: Expanding the Cognitive-Behavioral Tradition</h2><p><p></p>This volume examines the role of mindfulness principles and practices in a range of well-established cognitive and behavioral treatment approaches.

J�rgen Osterhammel, an eminent scholar who has been called the Braudel of the nineteenth century, moves beyond conventional Eurocentric and chronological accounts of the era, presenting instead a truly global history of breathtaking scope and towering erudition. He examines the powerful and complex forces that drove global change during the "long nineteenth century," taking readers from New York to New Delhi, from the Latin American revolutions to the Taiping Rebellion, from the perils and promise of Europe's transatlantic labor markets to the hardships endured by nomadic, tribal peoples across the planet. Osterhammel describes a world increasingly networked by the telegraph, the steamship, and the railways. He explores the changing relationship between human beings and nature, looks at the importance of cities, explains the role slavery and its abolition played in the emergence of new nations, challenges the widely held belief that the nineteenth century witnessed the triumph of the nation-state, and much more.</p><p>This is the highly anticipated English edition of the spectacularly successful and critically acclaimed German book, which is also being translated into Chinese, Polish, Russian, and French. Indispensable for any historian, <i>The Transformation of the World</i> sheds important new light on this momentous epoch, showing how the nineteenth century paved the way for the global catastrophes of the twentieth century, yet how it also gave rise to pacifism, liberalism, the trade union, and a host of other crucial developments.</p></p><p><p>"J�rgen Osterhammel is the Braudel of the nineteenth century. His global panorama is a triumph of the historian's craft. In elegant and lucid prose, he examines, across the entire world, the Janus face of the era: both distant past and yet also origin of our contemporary condition."<b>--Jonathan Sperber, author of <i>Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life</i></b></p><p>"The comparison with Braudel's magnum opus is not misplaced. Osterhammel's <i>The Transformation of the World</i> is a brilliant work of historical imagination, of absolutely show-stealing erudition, and of wide-apertured original insight! Reflecting on space and time, empire and slavery, war and peace, economy and diplomacy, monarchy and opera, and much else, Osterhammel changes our whole understanding of the nineteenth century."<b>--Helmut W. Smith, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>"This big, kaleidoscopic book follows the many strands of change over the course of a long century of transformation. It belongs on a short list of key resources for understanding the origins of many of the challenges we face today."<b>--John E. Wills, Jr., University of Southern California</b></p><p>"Arguably the most important book by a German historian to be published in the past quarter century. It is a truly magisterial account of the global history of the nineteenth century, powerfully argued and beautifully rendered."<b>--Sven Beckert, author of <i>The Monied Metropolis: New York City and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie, 1850-1896</i></b></p><b>J�rgen Osterhammel</b> is professor of modern and contemporary history at the University of Konstanz.

(Spanish Edition)</h2><p>This is a Spanish edition of Don Quijote designed for English-speaking students. Both parts, Parts 1 and 2, of Don Quijote are included in this single volume. This Legacy edition is edited by Tom Lathrop. Until now, our students have had to use editions published in Spain for Spaniards. Vocabulary and syntactic structures that are difficult (or impossible) for our students are usually not annotated in those editions. Cultural information which educated Spanish speakers already know, but our students simply do not, is equally not annotated. Our students have thus been deprived of much of what they need to know in order to understand the text. To help solve the vocabulary problem, Lathrop has included 10,459 vocabulary glosses in the margin opposite the line where the Spanish word to be defined appears. If too many words need to be put in the margin, phrases are translated in footnotes. In all, there are 3,742 footnotes. These also deal with cultural items, historical, geographical, biblical, mythological, textual references, and all kinds of other information. Footnotes will not offer interpretations: that is for instructors and their students to figure out. This edition features 55 full page illustrations by Jack Davis and a revised index.</p><p></p><h2>You Have It Made: Delicious, Healthy, Do-Ahead Meals</h2><p><b>Make-ahead recipes from&nbsp;the longtime Food Network star and best-selling author</b><br><br> Ellie Krieger,&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best-selling and multi-award-winning author, has written a cookbook devoted to the kind of recipes that her fans have been waiting for&#x2014;make-ahead meals.

Farnsworth&#39;s book collects the most eloquent examples, arranges them by theme, and provides the historical and cultural backdrops that inspired their use. He offers specific accounts of where metaphors originate, how they have been and can be used and why they work.

McIntyre, <i>The Baltimore Sun</i><br><br>Farnsworth's Classical English Metaphor promises and delivers a gallery of metaphor-masterworks...It is one of those books that inspires a reviewer to sing the delights of dipping in at random or of setting by a bedside for insomniac diversion...But there is another, less precious upshot to the book's mosaic of metaphors: it gives emphasis not to the genius of individual authors, but to the potential of the English language.--<i>Essays &amp; Criticism</i><br>Impressively well written, deftly organized, superbly presented, a brilliant informational treatise...Very highly recommended for both community and academic libraries.--Willis Buhle, <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>This handsome book...[is structured as] a scholarly anatomy of metaphors, [but] he recognizes that most people will find it a grab-bag of memorable quotations, an ideal browsing book for the nightstand.--Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>A superb job. Figuratively speaking, this is the best book that can be found. --Bryan A. Garner, author of <i>Garner's Modern English Usage</i><br><br>A feat of elegant demystification...Farnsworth is able to focus on the finite material of metaphorical referents...a brilliant strategy, both in its utility for writers and the inherent insight Farnsworth's divisions suggest about metaphors.--Jonathan Russell Clark, <i>The Millions</i><br><br>A book to linger in, like an imaginatively interactive museum. --Patrick Kurp, <i>Anecdotal Evidence</i> <br><br>I want this book to be beside my bed for years to come, a treasure-house of the liquid magic of words. --Simon Winchester, author of <i>The Professor and the Madman</i></p><h2>True Notebooks: A Writer&#39;s Year at Juvenile Hall</h2><p>In 1997 Mark Salzman, bestselling author <b>Iron and Silk</b> and <b>Lying Awake</b>, paid a reluctant visit to a writing class at L.A.&#x2019;s Central Juvenile Hall, a lockup for violent teenage offenders, many of them charged with murder.

Cole's lively text, with examples drawn from daily life, presents some quite complicated scientific information about how the five senses work. Smith's line-and-watercolor cartoons add to the fun even as they help explain the physiology. There are simple diagrams of the eye, ear, nose, and tongue, and explanations about how nerves "like wires" carry messages to the brain. Experiments encourage kids to "try this" and discover, for example, how the sense of taste gets a lot of help from the sense of smell.

The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights into the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, the culture of man. With the completion of their life's work they look back and ask what history has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man's long journey through war, conquest and creation - and for the great themes that can help us to understand our own era.<p>To the Durants, history is "not merely a warning reminder of man's follies and crimes, but also an encouraging remembrance of generative souls ... a spacious country of the mind wherein a thousand saints, statesman, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers still live and speak, teach and carve and sing..."</p><p>Designed to accompany the ten-volume set of "The Story of Civilization, The Lessons of History" is, in its own right, a profound and original work of history and philosophy.</p></p><p><b>Will Durant</b> (1885-1981) was an award-winning American writer, historian, and philosopher. He and his wife were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 for <i>Rousseau and Revolution</i>, and he was a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Durant spent over forty years writing the critically acclaimed eleven-volume <i>Story of Civilization</i>, the later volumes with the help of his wife, Ariel. He sought to revitalize history by unifying and humanizing the great body of historical knowledge, which had become voluminous and fragmented into esoteric subcategories. He also strove to bring philosophy to the common man. Durant was a champion of human rights, social reform, and the brotherhood of man long before they became well-known issues.<br><br> <b>Ariel Durant</b> (1898-1981) was a Russian-born American researcher and writer and the coauthor of the eleven-volume <i>Story of Civilization</i> with her husband Will Durant. Ariel and Will Durant were jointly awarded the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction in 1968 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1977. Ariel was named the 1977 Woman of the Year by the city of Los Angeles.<br><br><b>Chapter 1</b><br><b>Hesitations</b><br>As his studies come to a close the historian faces the challenge: Of what use have your studies been? Have you found in your work only the amusement of recounting the rise and fall of nations and ideas, and retelling "sad stories of the death of kings"? Have you learned more about human nature than the man in the street can learn without so much as opening a book? Have you derived from history any illumination of our present condition, any guidance for our judgments and policies, any guard against the rebuffs of surprise or the vicissitudes of change? Have you found such regularities in the sequence of past events that you can predict the future actions of mankind or the fate of states? Is it possible that, after all, "history has no sense," that it teaches us nothing, and that the immense past was only the weary rehearsal of the mistakes that the future is destined to make on a larger stage and scale?<br>At times we feel so, and a multitude of doubts assail our enterprise. To begin with, do we really know what the past was, what actually happened, or is history "a fable" not quite "agreed upon"? Our knowledge of any past event is always incomplete, probably inaccurate, beclouded by ambivalent evidence and biased historians, and perhaps distorted by our own patriotic or religious partisanship. "Most history is guessing, and the rest is prejudice." Even the historian who thinks to rise above partiality for his country, race, creed, or class betrays his secret predilection in his choice of materials, and in the nuances of his adjectives. "The historian always oversimplifies, and hastily selects a manageable minority of facts and faces out of a crowd of souls and events whose multitudinous complexity he can never quite embrace or comprehend." -- Again, our conclusions from the past to the future are made more hazardous than ever by the acceleration of change. In 1909 Charles Peguy thought that "the world changed less since Jesus Christ than in the last thirty years". and perhaps some young doctor of philosophy in physics would now add that his science has changed more since 1909 than in all recorded time before. Every year -- sometimes, in war, every month -- some new invention, method, or situation compels a fresh adjustment of behavior and ideas. -- Furthermore, an element of chance, perhaps of freedom, seems to enter into the conduct of metals and men. We are no longer confident that atoms, much less organisms, will respond in the future as we think they have responded in the past. The electrons, like Cowper's God, move in mysterious ways their wonders to perform, and some quirk of character or circumstance may upset national equations, as when Alexander drank himself to death and let his new empire fall apart (323 B.C.), or as when Frederick the Great was saved from disaster by the accession of a Czar infatuated with Prussian ways (1762).<br>Obviously historiography cannot be a science. It can only be an industry, an art, and a philosophy -- an industry by ferreting out the facts, an art by establishing a meaningful order in the chaos of materials, a philosophy by seeking perspective and enlightenment. "The present is the past rolled up for action, and the past is the present unrolled for understanding" -- or so we believe and hope. In philosophy we try to see the part in the light of the whole; in the "philosophy of history" we try to see this moment in the light of the past. We know that in both cases this is a counsel of perfection; total perspective is an optical illusion. We do not know the whole of man's history; there were probably many civilizations before the Sumerian or the Egyptian; we have just begun to dig! We must operate with partial knowledge, and be provisionally content with probabilities; in history, as in science and politics, relativity rules, and all formulas should be suspect. "History smiles at all attempts to force its flow into theoretical patterns or logical grooves; it plays havoc with our generalizations, breaks all our rules; history is baroque." Perhaps, within these limits, we can learn enough from history to bear reality patiently, and to respect one another's delusions.<br>Since man is a moment in astronomic time, a transient guest of the earth, a spore of his species, a scion of his race, a composite of body, character, and mind, a member of a family and a community, a believer or doubter of a faith, a unit in an economy, perhaps a citizen in a state or a soldier in an army, we may ask under the corresponding heads -- astronomy, geology, geography, biology, ethnology, psychology, morality, religion, economics, politics, and war -- what history has to say about the nature, conduct, and prospects of man. It is a precarious enterprise, and only a fool would try to compress a hundred centuries into a hundred pages of hazardous conclusions. We proceed.<br>Copyright � 1968 by Will and Ariel Durant</p><h2>Dictionary Of Subjects And Symbols In Art: Revised Edition</h2><p>Identifies and explains the religious, historical, mythical, literary, and other figures and themes upon which the repertoire of European art is based</p><p><br>The understanding and enjoyment of a work of art depends as much on the story it depicts as on the artist&#x2019;s execution of it. But what were once biblical or classical commonplaces are not so readily recognizable today. This book relates in a succinct and readable way the themes, sacred and secular, on which the repertoire of Western art is based. Combined here in a single volume are religious, classical, and historical themes, figures of moral allegory, and characters from romantic poetry that appeared throughout paintings and sculpture in Western art before and after the Renaissance. More than just a dictionary, this text places these subjects in their narrative, historical, or mythological context and uses extensive cross-referencing to enhance and clarify the meanings of these themes for the reader.<br><br>The definitive work by which others are compared, this volume has become an indispensable handbook for students and general appreciators alike. This wholly redesigned second edition includes a new insert of images chosen by the author, as well as a new preface and index to highlight the ideas, beliefs, and social and religious customs that form the background of much of this subject matter.<br><br><b>Praise for the previous edition</b><br><br>?It is clearly written, well arranged, and can be read for its own sake as a compendium of the image-making faculty of Western man.

Reprinted four times between 1791 and 1795 and satirised as representative of the Gothic genre by Jane Austen in <b>Northanger Abbey</b>, Radcliffe&#x2019;s tense masterpiece, in which the heroine is afraid even to look in the mirror for fear of what she might see behind her, established her reputation as a writer and her brilliant descriptions of both characters and scenes serve to create the perfect atmosphere for a novel packed with emotional intensity.Chloe Chard is Lecturer in English at the University of Sheffield.</p><h2>Economics For Dummies</h2><p>If you think economics is a complicated discipline that&#x2019;s reserved for theorists and the intellectual elite and has nothing to do with you, think again.

It has sold millions of copies and inspired generations with its galvanizing wisdom on how to lead an artistic life. In <em>You Must Change Your Life</em>, debut author Rachel Corbett tells the remarkable, long-buried story of where Rilke&#x2019;s ideas originated.</p><p>In 1902, Rilke, broke and suffering from writer&#x2019;s block, accepted a commission to go to Paris to research and write a short book about the sculptor Auguste Rodin. The two were almost polar opposites: Rodin in his sixties, notoriously carnal, revered; Rilke in his twenties, delicate, unknown. Nonetheless, they fell into an instantaneous friendship and would work closely together as master and disciple for the next few years, as Rodin showed Rilke how to become the writer he wished to be.</p><p>With verve and great insight, Corbett transports readers to turn-of-the-twentieth-century Paris to explore this surprising friendship and the development of their influential ideas about art and creativity. She captures the dawn of modernism with appearances by such charismatic figures as Paul C�zanne, Henri Matisse, Isadora Duncan, George Bernard Shaw, and Jean Cocteau, as well as the rise of the concept of &#x201c;empathy&#x201d; amid the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Georg Simmel. Corbett also introduces the women in these men&#x2019;s lives, many of them esteemed writers and artists in their own right: Rodin&#x2019;s muse Camille Claudel, Rilke&#x2019;s wife and fellow artist Clara Westhoff, and the remarkable Lou Andreas-Salome, who was Nietzsche&#x2019;s lover and Rilke&#x2019;s lifelong friend.</p><p><em>You Must Change Your Life</em> is a vibrant portrait of Rilke and Rodin&#x2019;s singular friendship, heartbreaking rift, and moving reconciliation, and it is a testament to the ways their work continues to reverberate to this day.</p> 16 illustrations</p><p>Rachel Corbett is the editor in chief of Modern Painters.

Here is a brief overview of each part:<br><br>Part 1, Seeing the Big Picture Connections First, defines curriculum in terms of rigor, provides the background of this model, connects curriculum design to the &#x201c;big picture&#x201d; of standards, assessments, instruction, and data practices, previews the step-by-step design sequence, and introduces end-of-chapter reader assignments.<br><br>Part 2, Building the Foundation for Designing Curricular Units, explains the five steps that must first be taken to lay the foundation upon which to build the curricular units of study, and provides explicit guidelines for applying each step.<br><br>Part 3, Designing the Curricular Unit of Study&#x2014;From Start to Finish, gives the &#x201c;nuts and bolts&#x201d; directions for designing a rigorous curricular unit of study, from beginning to end, and concludes with an overview of how to implement the unit in the classroom or instructional program. Formatively assessing students along the way, educators analyze resulting student data to diagnose student learning needs and then adjust ongoing instruction accordingly.<br><br>Part 4, Organizing, Monitoring, and Sustaining Implementation Efforts, addresses the role of administrators in beginning and continuing the work of implementation. These final three chapters provide first-person narra - tives and advice to administrators from administrators who have personally led the implementation and sustainability efforts of curriculum redesign and related practices within their own school systems.<br><br>I have endeavored to pull together all of the elements necessary for designing a rigorous curriculum, to position these elements in a sequential order, and to provide a step-by-step approach for constructing each one. My hope is that this road map will not only &#x201c;show you the way&#x201d; to design your own curriculum, but also allow you the flexibility of customizing it to fit your own purpose and needs.<br><br>As with the realization of any lofty vision, it will take a great deal of time, thought, energy, and collaboration to create and revise a single curriculum, let alone multiple curricula. The best advice I can offer is to regard whatever you produce as a continual &#x201c;work in progress,&#x201d; to be accomplished over one, two, or three years, or even longer. As my friend and colleague Robert Kuklis points out, curriculum designers &#x201c;shape and modify the process as they move through it. It is important that they know this is not a rigid, prescriptive procedure, but rather an opportunity for learning, adapting, and improving. This preserves fidelity to the process, encourages flexibility, and promotes local ownership.&#x201d;<br><br>Whenever people&#x2019;s spirits need lifting because the work seems so demanding, remind everyone that it is a process, not a one-time event. You are creating something truly significant&#x2014;a comprehensive body of work that is going to serve your educators, students, and parents for years to come!<br></p><p>Applicable to every grade, course, and content area, you will learn: <br><br>What rigorous curriculum is and how to create, sequence, and pace such a curriculum<br><br>Why seeing the "big picture" connections first is essential to beginning curriculum design<br><br>How to design a grade- or course-specific curricular unit of study, from start to finish<br><br>How to use formative assessments and data analysis to guide instruction before, during, and after each unit<br><br>How leaders can organize, implement, and sustain this model throughout the school and/or school systemLarry Ainsworth is the Executive Director of Professional Development at The Leadership and Learning Center in Englewood, Colorado.

Pitting the legendary Pancho Villa against &#x201c;the Colonel,&#x201d; a thrill-seeking Bostonian railroad tycoon whose fading fortune is tied up in a colossal ranch in Chihuahua, <em>El Paso</em> opens during a time of dramatic upheaval in Mexico&#x2015;its government being squeezed on one end by Villa&#x2019;s revolutionaries and on the other by &#x201c;filthy&#x201d; American capitalists.</p><p>Content to observe the war from aboard his dazzling yacht, the <em>Ajax</em>, the Colonel is suddenly pulled into this drama when his famous Valle del Sol ranch is raided for nearly &#x201c;two million and a half dollars in beef on the hoof.&#x201d; Oblivious to the realities of war and hoping to salvage his losses, the Colonel whisks his family down to Mexico where they make a disturbing discovery: it was Villa who not only stole the cattle but also murdered their beloved ranch manager. Even worse, Villa&#x2019;s henchmen abduct the Colonel&#x2019;s grandchildren in another daring raid only days later.</p><p>Frantic, the aging patriarch and his adopted son race to El Paso, hoping to gather a group of cowboys brave enough to hunt down the generalissimo on his own turf. As the desperate Yankees quickly learn once they return to Chihuahua, their deep pockets and political clout mean next to nothing in a crumbling nation rife with communist sympathizers. After weeks of searching and with no trace of Villa, the Colonel fears all is lost&#x2015;that is, until a twist of fate unites his party with that of Johnny Ollas, an aspiring matador whose wife has also been kidnapped by the marauding revolutionaries. Bloodied and battered, the two factions unite, galloping off on an extraordinary manhunt through some of the most inhospitable terrain on earth: the vast and snake-ridden Sierra Madre.</p><p>The novel explodes into an epic as an extraordinary cast of characters from both history and imagination begin to emerge, all vying to get their hands on the ever-elusive Villa. But no matter what prize each player ultimately seeks, no one is left unscathed in this sprawling story of heroism, injustice, and love. Replete with shootouts, daring escapes, and an unforgettable bullfight, <em>El Paso</em> brings to life a crucial moment in history and, in the process, becomes an indelible portrait of the American Southwest in the final days of the wild frontier.</p></p><p>Winston Groom is the author of twenty previous books, including Forrest Gump, Conversations with the Enemy (Pulitzer Prize finalist), Shiloh 1862, and The Generals. He served in Vietnam with the Fourth Infantry Division and lives in Point Clear, Alabama.&#x201c;Groom has unleashed a new work of imaginative, peripatetic fiction. . . .

Battles, a tense prisoner exchange, and clever ransom negotiations round out this historically vivid and marvelously complex tale.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Dark and daring, <em>El Paso</em> does for the West what Gump did for the South &#x2015; it takes a tumultuous, crucial time in American history and feeds it to us in ways acute and unforgettable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Laura Taylor, <em>Oxford Exchange</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>El Paso</em> has the drama, coincidence and class intrigue of Dickens's <em>Great Expectations</em> in a setting reminiscent of Larry McMurtry's <em>Lonesome Dove</em>. . . . In Groom's capable hands, this history mixes easily into what is at its core a story of family, class warfare, loyalty and the violence of revolution.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bruce Jacobs, <em>Shelf Awareness</em></strong></p><h2>Beowulf (Broadview Literary Texts)</h2><p>The classic story of Beowulf, hero and dragon-slayer, appears here in a new translation accompanied by genealogical charts, historical summaries, and a glossary of proper names. These and other documents sketching some of the cultural forces behind the poem&#39;s final creation will help readers see Beowulf as an exploration of the politics of kingship and the psychology of heroism, and as an early English meditation on the bridges and chasms between the pagan past and the Christian present. A generous sample of other modern versions of Beowulf sheds light on the process of translating the poem.</p><p>The Broadview Literary Texts series is an effort to represent the ever-changing canon of literature in English by bringing together texts long regarded as classics with valuable, though lesser-known literature.R.M. Liuzza (Associate Professor of English, Tulane University) is the author of The Old English Version of the Gospels (Oxford, 1994).</p><h2>The Souls of Black Folk (Bantam Classics)</h2><p>"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line." Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i>, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.<br><br>Far ahead of its time, <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i> both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of DuBois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.</p><p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.<p> With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual "sorrow songs" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in "On Booker T. Washington and Others," where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: "Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races," he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking "withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens." The capstone of <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's "double consciousness," which he described as "a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>First published in 1903, this eloquent collection of essays exposed the magnitude of racism in our society. The book endures today as a classic document of American social and political history: a manifesto that has influenced generations with its transcendent vision for change.</p><h2>Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations: From Prehistory to 640 CE</h2><p>Challenging the stereotypes and myths that typically characterize students' understanding of antiquity, <em>Ancient Mediterranean Civilizations: From Prehistory to 640 CE</em> focuses on <strong>continuity</strong> and <strong>connections,</strong> along with <strong>cultural diffusion</strong> and <strong>cultural diversity,</strong> to show how history is a cumulative process and that numerous themes recur in different times and places.

What do race, ethnicity, and nationalism have to do with sex? <em>Race, Ethnicity, and Sexuality</em> addresses these questions, exploring the intimate intersections and forbidden frontiers where ethnicity and sexuality meet face-to-face. Through numerous examples from the U.S. and beyond-and from the past and the present-the book illustrates the power of sex to shape ideas and feelings about race, ethnicity, and the nation. It shows how sexual images, fears, and desires help form racial, ethnic, and national stereotypes, differences, and conflicts. <br> In this unique work, Joane Nagel demonstrates how ethnicity and sexuality join hands to fashion new, hybrid identities, communities, and cultures; how the volatile mixture of race and sex can spark ethnic violence; and how ethnosexual encounters can simultaneously resist and reinforce racial, ethnic, and national boundaries. She skillfully blends styles of inquiry and interpretation from the social sciences and the humanities to craft a convincing and illuminating account using images, poetry, fieldwork, Internet postings, interviews, literature, ethnographies, historical texts, archival documents, biographies, census data, journals, and personal accounts. <em>Race, Ethnicity, and Sexuality</em> is an ideal text for undergraduate courses in race and ethnicity; sexuality; race/gender/class; gender studies; ethnic studies; multicultural and diversity studies; or globalization studies.<br></p><p>Joane Nagel is at University of Kansas.</p><h2>The Virginian: A Horseman of the Plains (Signet Classics)</h2><p><b>With a new introduction by Robert B.

A socially inept but warmhearted landowner pursues his own visions instead of conforming to conventional views. The adulteress and the philosopher head the vibrant cast of characters in <i>Anna Karenina,</i> Tolstoy's tumultuous tale of passion and self-discovery. <br>This novel marks a turning point in the author's career, the juncture at which he turned from fiction toward faith. Set against a backdrop of the historic social changes that swept Russia during the late nineteenth century, it reflects Tolstoy's own personal and psychological transformation. Two worlds collide in the course of this epochal story: that of the old-time aristocrats, who struggle to uphold their traditions of serfdom and authoritarian government, and that of the Westernizing liberals, who promote technology, rationalism, and democracy. This cultural clash unfolds in a compelling, emotional drama of seduction, betrayal, and redemption.</p><p>Some people say <i>Anna Karenina</i> is the single greatest novel ever written, which makes about as much sense to me as trying to determine the world's greatest color. But there is no doubt that <i>Anna Karenina</i>, generally considered Tolstoy's best book, is definitely one ripping great read. Anna, miserable in her loveless marriage, does the barely thinkable and succumbs to her desires for the dashing Vronsky. I don't want to give away the ending, but I will say that 19th-century Russia doesn't take well to that sort of thing.Introduction by John Bayley</p><h2>Reflect and Relate: An Introduction to Interpersonal Communication</h2><p><p>In <i>Reflect &amp; Relate</i>, distinguished teacher and scholar Steve McCornack arms students with the best theory and most up-to-date research and then helps them relate that knowledge to their own experiences.

He has published scholarly papers on the rise of Jewish nationalism, on the eminent Russian Jewish historian Simon Dubnow, and on the history of the Jews in Eastern Europe. </p><p> Like every distinctive heritage, Judaism must be understood as a creative response to ultimate issues of human concern by members of a group that has faced a unique concatenation of political, economic, and geographical circumstances. And the Jewish historical experience is more unusual than most. Standing both within and without the mainstream of Western culture, Judaism offers remarkable insights into the genesis and elaboration of powerful religious ideas and into the determined survival of a small, vulnerable people repeatedly forced to confront and adjust to conditions beyond its immediate control. </p> <p> In this work, I have attempted to survey the Jewish historical landscape and orient the reader to its main features, opening up for him access to the rich scholarly literature on Jewish history, theology, philosophy, mysticism, and social thought that has been produced in the last century and a half. The subject of every section of every chapter involves the lifework of several researchers. Within the limits of the space available to me I have tried to provide a reasonably detailed introduction to a complex, ramified, and intellectually challenging field of humanistic learning. </p> <p> The structure and contents of this book have been affected by the following considerations. First, I felt that it was necessary to include enough general historic4-background that the reader could glimpse the larger context in which each new phase of Judaism emerged out of previous phases. The separateness of Judaism has always been relative rather than absolute. The overall political and social milieu and the spiritual climate have shaped, sometimes subtly and sometimes conspicuously, the Jewish condition. Jewry has responded selectively and according to its own criteria of meaning and value to events affecting non-Jews as well; Judaism, at the same time, has exerted a reciprocal influence, direct or indirect, on the general course of historical development. It is always necessary to adjust the usual rubrics of history, such as ancient, medieval, and modern, to the particular contours of Jewish identity to define the changing subjective borders between Jew and non-Jew. Thus, it was a crucial transition when Judaism passed from being the only monotheistic civilization in a polytheistic world to being the monotheism of a minority living in lands where the state religions of the Christian or Muslim majority were spiritual descendants of Judaism; and it was another crucial transition when the secularization of European society set in motion a variety of contradictory redefinitions of the status and core of modern Jewish identity. Second, I have tried to avoid falsifying the nature of Jewish history through oversimplification. The social profile and institutional structure of Jewry have been modified to such an extent in the course of centuries that no single definition of the Jews in a few words is possible, except that they are the continuation of previous Jewish generations. Emerging from a collectivity of seminomadic clans and tribes, the Jews during some periods were mainly peasants and fighters; in later periods they have been predominately urban artisans and merchants, sometimes widely scattered in small villages and towns, sometimes concentrated in a few geographical regions or in the major cities of the world. There have been centuries when Jewish identity was primarily an unquestioned matter of descent, and ages when proselytes have been enthusiastically sought or when positive Jewish loyalty involved a strong element of personal choice. Discrimination, hatred, and violence against Jews have marked certain epochs, alternating with times of relative security when there were some tangible, as well as psychological, advantages of belonging to the Jewish minority. For over 1,500 years Jewry was rooted in its original homeland (surely the return of a large proportion of modern Jews to that homeland is one of the most striking chapters in the history of any people), yet there is hardly any part of the world that has not seen one or more waves of Jewish settlement. Owing to the adaptability of Judaism, centrifugal tendencies of diaspora produced regional varieties of Jewish custom and culture&#x2014;only to have other, centripetal, forces bring these separate Jewish ethnicities together into crucibles where new forms of Jewishness emerged. And in the course of history the Jewish people has had various, quite different political and intellectual elites: monarchs and ethnarchs, priests and sages, scholars and elected communal officials. The survival of the Jewish group has been the triumph of continuity over periodic sometimes drastic, change. </p> <p> Third, I have tried to indicate that the intellectual history of the Jewish people exhibits a complexity similar to that of its social history. The character of Jewish thought&#x2014;whether it was innovative or conservative, whether it took a collective or individualistic form of expression&#x2014;has been a function of the nature of Jewish society at the time, of the presence or absence of internal sectarian or political controversy, and of the roles that Jewish writers, sages, and intellectuals projected for themselves with respect to the people and God. Jewish intellectual history embraces periods of conscious encounter with the most sophisticated general modes of philosophical and scientific thought and eras of relative intellectual isolation when Jewish legal, theological, and mystical preoccupations do not correspond in any obvious way to those of adjacent cultures. In certain centuries some Jewish intellectuals have enthusiastically adapted rationalism to the defense of their faith, whereas their contemporaries or successors rejected rationalism as undermining religion and threatening the integrity of the Jewish tradition. I have tried to describe most of the principal modes of thought that have been called Jewish by Jews, so that the reader can gain an overall and representative conception of the subtraditions of Judaism and their outstanding individual exemplars. But there is a unity with the diversity of Jewish thought. The Jewish intellectual heritage is not merely a sequence of writings produced by Jews, but a consideration of issues arising out of the biblical world view, augmented and reshaped by later concerns and partaking in a self-transforming unity of themes, symbols, and beliefs. The convictions that there is only one God who created the universe and who guides history, that He commands justice and mercy, and that Israel is His people provide the starting points and focus of Jewish religious thought throughout most of history and affect secular Jewishness in the modern world as well. </p> <p> Above all, it has been the aim of this book to address itself to one of the greatest puzzles facing the modern student: that Jewish history is at the same time an account of a people and a religion&#x2014;a very unusual people and a religion exactly like no other, both of which have to be understood according to their own dynamics and their own categories. The overarching unity of the societal and the ideational poles of Jewish historical experience seems to me to require that each be treated in some detail. Neither a history of the Jewish people that mentions only in passing the greatest Jewish thinkers nor a history of Jewish thought that is forced to omit much of the Jewish historical continuum, conveys the rich uniqueness of Jewish identity. A grasp of the interrelationship of these two levels of the common denominator "Jewish" should accompany the reader's exploration of particular phases and elements of Jewish history. It is crucial in an introductory survey to exhibit the interplay between the body and the mind of Judaism, because, in the long run, the social shaped the ideational and the ideational shaped the social in surprising ways. </p> <p> A brief explanation of some specific choices I have made in the process of writing this book: For practical and historical reasons, I decided to present the Bible according to its traditional format, not according to the preliminary oral or literary phases that were absorbed into the final text. Familiarity with the Bible can not be taken for granted in a beginning study of Judaism, and a description of the contents of the principal biblical books&#x2014;with historical explanations and flashbacks in passing&#x2014;seemed useful. Moreover, it was the Bible as a whole, not its earlier components, that became the groundwork for the development of Judaism in subsequent periods. Second, I have tried to convey, when dealing with certain formative periods of Judaism such as the rise of monotheism end the religious ferment of the first century BCE and the first century CE, the awareness that limited and uncertain data make every reconstruction conjectural and a subject of considerable scholarly dispute. Third, I regret that limitation of space prevented more extended treatment of certain topics, but I wanted to concentrate on those intellectual movements, such as philosophy and mysticism, which, in the long run, represent the most self-conscious speculation on the truth of Judaism, and it was imperative that they be presented with adequate scope. Finally, a word on why I devoted so much attention to modern Jewish secular thought. I believe that Jewish secularism has features that differentiate it from secularism in general and make it a reexamination, from a new perspective, of the meaning of Jewish existence. Secular Zionism has been, of course, one of the most vital movements of modern Jewish renewal and its diagnosis of the Jewish predicament cannot be ignored. No one can describe Judaism, especially its recent trends, without assumptions and a position of his own, but I hope that mine are sufficiently inclusive and catholic not to distort unfairly any of the movements I have portrayed. It is my conviction, however, that the future of Judaism as a coherent world view, and therefore as an identity with continued personal relevance, involves philosophical and theological exploration of the kind indicated in the last chapter. </p> <p> I would like to record my gratitude to those who have helped me during the years when this book was in preparation. The original plan for a history of Jewish thought was conceived by me and Rabbi Jack Bemporad, now of Dallas, Texas; I am grateful to him for memorable conversations and for materials on the Bible, Hellenistic Judaism, and Jewish philosophy. Although in the course of time the book took on a different character and all responsibility for the present version is mine, without the stimulation of his friendship and learning I would hardly have set out. I have had the benefit also of insightful comments and suggestions by Professors Matitiahu Tsevat, Joseph L. Blau, Martin A. Cohen, Eugene B. Borowitz, Rabbi Edward Schecter, Dr. Irving Levitas, and Philip Winograd, all of whom read part or all of the manuscript. I am indebted to several of my colleagues in the History Department of Hunter College: Professors Nancy G. Siraisi and Naomi W. Cohen for criticizing sections that fell into their purview, and my chairman, Professor Naomi C. Miller, for her constant encouragement and wise advice. A fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1973-74 gave me the leisure to do research on various topics, and I was also fortunate to receive a grant from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture in 1972. At Macmillan, Charles E. Smith, Ron Harris, and above all, my editor, Kenneth J. Scott, have been exceedingly patient and helpful, despite the many delays I forced on them. The friendship and assistance of Rosalie Bachana were invaluable. Major typing and other responsibilities were handled by my sister, Frances Mendlow, and by Brenda Parnes and Nanci Kramer. Art research was done by Lucy Rosenfeld, who adroitly helped me choose pictures illustrative of each period of Jewish history and of its general environment. Only I should be blamed for mistakes of fact and interpretation and for errors of emphasis and omission. I cannot begin to recount the role of my wife in making possible the completion of this endeavor. </p> <p> <b>R. M.

Professor Velasquez&#39;s research interests lie in the field of business ethics, and he has published numerous articles in journals such as the ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW, THE BUSINESS ETHICS QUARTERLY, SOCIAL JUSTICE RESEARCH, and THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL."The Velasquez text's three greatest "content" strengths are its inclusion of feminists', buddhists' and pragmatists' points of view in most chapters; its narrative about the topics, with important excerpts, rather than original works with important annotation; and its incorporation of difficult issues like "science" into many chapters, rather than in only one difficult one. The structural strength of the book includes its opening explanations in each chapter of how the philosophical issues of the chapter make a difference in the students' lives (although some are not quite pertinent or on the mark; e.g., in ethics); its breaking down of the chapters into small subsections which make the study of philosophy seem less daunting and which help focus the initial discussions; and the inviting and attractive graphic design of the book." Diane Wilkinson, Alabama A&amp;M University<br><br>"I searched for months before selecting a permanent text for my Introduction to Philosophy course; I chose the Velasquez text and have never regretted it for a moment. No matter what topic comes up in the class, there is a section I can have students turn to in order to drive points home philosophically or take advantage of opportunities for teachable moments which broaden students' outlook on life."- Diane Wilkinson, Alabama A&amp;M University<br><br>"The author's writing is clear and pitched at the appropriate level; indeed, I sympathize with the sort of challenge that anybody faces in trying to explain abstract topics in an intelligible way. Here the inclusion of the 'Philosophy at the Movies' referrals permits the making of points that connect with students." George Lujan, Mission College<br><br>"In my own view, Velasquez provides an essential background against which to allow those of us who lecture using the text to offer examples that illuminate the points made in the text. References to common 'life experiences' such as, for example, seeing somebody whom we recognize at a far-off distance even before we can articulate the grounds that justify our claiming to know just who it is can help illuminate Kant's account of the way that intuitions and categories help structure experience but, as I noted earlier, Velasquez provides, in chapter 5, a framework within which to allow that sort of example to connect with the experiences of our students." George Lujan, Mission College<br><br>"The book's strongest asset, in my view, is precisely the clarity and just the right level of complexity and clarity for the community college student. It's a great introduction to philosophy: interesting for the non-specialist, but rigorous enough for students to get the hang of Real Philosophy. ...

Collins, 1848). While adapting this version of the fables, I consulted numerous other nineteenth-century translations and made various changes in keeping with the traditional plots. As has been the custom with translators and adapters of Aesop&#x2019;s fables, I have taken a good deal of poetic license at times. Since Mr. James&#x2019;s style is somewhat archaic, I have used a more modern American idiom in adapting them and have occasionally conceived new morals so that the fables might ring more &#x201c;true&#x201d; to the situation of the contemporary reader.</p><p>The illustrations are from Fables de La Fontaine illustrated by J.J. Grandville (Paris: H. Fournier, 1838). Grandville was a pseudonym for Jean Ignace Isidore G�rard (1803&#x2013;1847). Born in Nancy, he arrived in Paris during the 1820s and soon made a name for himself as a lithographer and political caricaturist. He was especially interested the theater and animals and was known for incorporating political satire into his complex and fastidious drawings. During the 1830s he turned to book illustration and composed 120 woodcuts for La Fontaine&#x2019;s fables, which were largely based on Aesop&#x2019;s work; he caused quite a stir by turning many of the animals into types of human beings. In doing this, Grandville&#x2019;s figures often appear grotesque and have a surreal quality to them. The distinction between beast and human is blurred, or rather, Grandville&#x2019;s keen eye captures stunning similarities between humans and animals that often make humans appear in a ridiculous light. In addition, Grandville takes pains to give a clear indication of the social status of the figures through their clothing and behavior to comment on the French mores of his time. There are many emblematic references to urban life in Paris, and in this respect Grandville was one of the first artists to address modern problems of the city and industrialization. Grandville also illustrated the Fables de S. Lavalette (1841) and theFables de Florian (1842), two minor French fabulists, in the same unique manner and is considered one of the greatest interpreters of Aesop&#x2019;s fables (through La Fontaine) for the modern age.</p><p>&#x2014;J.Z.</p><p><b>Introduction</b></p><p>Little is known about Aesop, except that he lived in Greece, probably between 600 and 500 B.C. Happily for readers, scribblers can rarely resist adorning empty biographies with tales&#x2014;appropriate in Aesop&#x2019;s case, since generations have celebrated him as the archetypal storyteller. &#x201c;What Aesop was by birth,&#x201d; Nathaniel Crouch wrote in 1737, &#x201c;authors don&#x2019;t agree, but that he was of a mean condition, and his person deformed to the highest degree, is what all affirm: he was flat-nos&#x2019;d, hunch-back&#x2019;d, bloober-lip&#x2019;d, jolt-headed: his body crooked all over, big-belly&#x2019;d, badger-legg&#x2019;d, and of a swarthy complexion. But the excellency and beauty of his mind made a sufficient atonement for the outward appearance of his person.&#x201d; Add that he stuttered terribly, quite a handicap for a philosophic raconteur, and Aesop becomes a man delightful to discover on the page, no matter the quality of his mind.</p><p>Fictional accounts of Aesop&#x2019;s life usually relate that he was sold as a slave in Ephesus. Later, in Samos, he behaved like Solomon, his wisdom reconciling the irreconcilable. After accusing magistrates at Delos of tomfoolery and corruption, however, he met a stony end. A gold cup pilfered from the shrine to the Oracle having been planted in his baggage, he was convicted of sacrilege and tossed &#x201c;head-long from a high rock.&#x201d; The moral being, I suppose, the wages of tale-telling will out.</p><p>In the literary underworld, lie and truth twine fruitfully together through generations, spawning page after page. Crouch lifted his life from the introduction of Roger L&#x2019;Estrange&#x2019;s famous collection of some five hundred fables published in 1692. In his collection published in 1722, Samuel Croxall took L&#x2019;Estrange to task, declaring, &#x201c;There were never so many blunders and childish dreams mixt up together, as are to be met with in the short compass of that piece.&#x201d; Knowing &#x201c;the little trifling circumstances&#x201d; of Aesop&#x2019;s life, Croxall said, was insignificant, &#x201c;whether he was a slave or a freeman, whether handsome or ugly. He has left us a legacy in his writings that will preserve his memory clean and perpetual among us.&#x201d;</p><p>Croxall also got matters wrong. Aesop told but did not write down fables. Much as The Thousand and One Nightsis a miscellany of stories drawn from diverse cultures stretching from Egypt to China, so the origins of Aesop&#x2019;s fables are various, all editions being mongrel blends of tales taken from countries around the Mediterranean and to the east.</p></p><h2>National Geographic Kids Chapters: Dog Finds Lost Dolphins: And More True Stories of Amazing Animal Heroes (NGK Chapters)</h2><p>The first in a line of Animal Rescues chapter books, <i>Dog Finds Lost Dolphins</i>&nbsp;is a tale you'll not soon forget. In this charming and awe-inspiring story you'll meet Cloud, the black lab with a nose for rescue. She's the only dog certified to sniff out stranded dolphins. Cloud can sniff out a dolphin over a mile off the coast of the Florida Keys. She has even become friends with them, waiting on the dock for them to pop up and give her a kiss. This and two more amazing stories are so engaging, readers will never want to put the book down!</p><p>.When Chris Blankenship got an emergency call to report to the beach, he expected it to be busy. And it was!<br> &nbsp;<br> About 80 dolphins were wriggling and squeaking in the shallow water. A small army of people worked quickly to help them. Team leaders barked orders. Volunteers put on wet suits for their turn in the water. News reporters were there too. They were looking for a big story.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris is a dolphin expert. He has seen dolphins and whales stuck on shore before. This time was different. Usually one or two dolphins get stuck in shallow water. Sometimes they get stuck in the twisty roots of mangrove trees. <i>But 80 dolphins!</i> Chris thought. <i>With so many, how do we know that we&#x2019;ve found them all?</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Every time a dolphin or whale gets stranded, it is a race against time. The sooner the dolphins are found, the easier it can be to save them. Chris ran his hands over a dolphin&#x2019;s smooth, rubbery skin. He thought how odd it was that such a good swimmer needed help.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dolphins are perfect for the underwater world. With their strong bodies and sleek fins, they can swim seven times faster than humans. They can hold their breath for more than 15 minutes and dive 2,000 feet (610 m) underwater.<br> &nbsp;<br> Dolphins are also very smart. They hunt in groups. They make up games to play. They even name themselves using whistling sounds. Many researchers spend their lives learning how dolphins communicate. In a dolphin&#x2019;s world, every click, whistle, and gesture has a meaning.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet sometimes dolphins end up in trouble. They can get stuck on a beach. It&#x2019;s a dangerous situation for them. By the time they are found, most stranded dolphins are sick or have died already.<br> &nbsp;<br> Why would such smart animals swim so close to a beach? We don&#x2019;t really<br> know. Maybe some stranded dolphins have been sick. Maybe pollution in the water confused them. Maybe they got lost during a storm at sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> In order to find the answer, scientists study stranded dolphins as they try to help them. They look for clues that will help them keep dolphins safe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris and the animal doctors got to work on the stranded dolphins. The first step: Make sure the dolphin can breathe. Dolphins are mammals, like humans. They have lungs and need to breathe air. They take in air through a blowhole on their back, behind their head. The stranded dolphins were very tired.<br> &nbsp;<br> They couldn&#x2019;t stay up on their bellies or swim on their own. People took turns holding the animals up so they could breathe. They rested the dolphins on their knees to keep their blowholes above water.<br> &nbsp;<br> The volunteers also kept the dolphins&#x2019; skin moist by splashing water on their bodies. A dolphin&#x2019;s exposed skin can dry out quickly in the hot Florida sun.<br> &nbsp;<br> A team examined each dolphin. They had to find out which dolphins were healthy enough to survive in the wild. The healthiest dolphins were helped back to deeper water right away. Sick dolphins were taken to a special hospital. There they were given medicine and food.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris popped a fish stuffed with medicine in a dolphin&#x2019;s mouth.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>This one is in rough shape, but it seems like a fighter,</i> he thought. Suddenly, a shout got Chris&#x2019;s attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Chris!&#x201d; yelled a volunteer. &#x201c;Quick! Come over here!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris ran down the beach to a spot full of mangrove trees. A small group of dolphins were stuck in the trees&#x2019; thick roots. They must have been separated from the main group. Now it was too late. They were too sick to save.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris sighed. <i>I wish we had some way of locating dolphins. Then we could get to them sooner.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> After that day, Chris kept thinking about what he had seen. He wondered if there was a better way to find lost dolphins. Then Chris started reading about some dogs that worked nearby. They were trained to search for people who get lost on or near the water. The dogs worked along beaches or from boats in the water. They sniffed the air for the missing person&#x2019;s smell. They could even smell objects that were slightly underwater.<br> &nbsp;<br> Chris wondered: <i>If dogs can find humans in the water, can they find dolphins too?</i></p><h2>Dark Emperor and Other Poems of the Night: A Newbery Honor Award Winner (Newbery Medal - Honors Title(s))</h2><p><p>A 2011 Newbery Honor Book</p><p>&nbsp;</p><i></i><i></i><i>Come feel the cool and shadowed breeze, <br>come smell your way among the trees, <br>come touch rough bark and leathered leaves: <br>Welcome to the night. <br></i><br>Welcome to the night, where mice stir and furry moths flutter.

For us humans--diurnal, sight-oriented creatures that we are--the darkness is alien and forbidding, especially in the woods (which already have dark, mythic undertones). But there are all sorts of creatures that prefer the dark, that thrive in the dark. Why? And how?

It covers both health and physical education while giving current and preservice teachers the skills to deliver appropriate lessons to their young students. </p><p> Retta Evans and Sandra Sims, respected educators and physical education advocates, provide everything teachers need in order to seamlessly incorporate health education and physical education into an integrated curriculum. Based on national health education, physical education, and state-specific academic standards including the Common Core state standards, this is a guide that will help teachers empower elementary students to become healthy and active. </p><p> The text is complemented with a full suite of ancillary products: </p><p> � Sample syllabus and course outline </p><p> � Chapter resources, including an overview, outline, review questions with answers, and learning activities </p><p> � Chapter questions to help in creating quick assessments of student learning or in building custom tests </p><p> � Approximately 150 slides to reinforce key points </p><p> The text also features lab exercises that allow students to practice the material they are learning, including designing their own standards-based lesson plans that integrate health and physical education. By learning the essential knowledge and using the invaluable strategies in this book, every teacher will be equipped to create a healthy and active school environment that maximizes student achievement. </p><p><i>Health and Physical Education for Elementary Classroom Teachers</i> is organized into two parts, each dedicated to different components of incorporating health and physical education into the elementary classroom. </p><p> Part I focuses on the foundational knowledge needed for teaching health and physical education. It addresses the health risk behaviors of today&#x2019;s generation of students, a team approach to coordinated school health, how physical growth and brain development in children are related to health, and the many characteristics and benefits of a high-quality physical education program. </p><p> Part II emphasizes the strategies necessary for incorporating health, physical education, and physical activity into the curriculum and school day. It discusses how teachers can become advocates of healthy and active schools, identify habits that promote everyday health in the classroom, and incorporate physical activity and the national standards into each school day. It also presents teaching methods, assessment tools, and evaluation strategies to ensure teaching success. </p><p> Throughout this book, practicing and training teachers will find websites, tips for best practices, sample lesson plans, and tables with innovative strategies. The result is a great resource that teachers can use to fulfill what is both a tremendous responsibility and a unique opportunity&#x2014;promoting health and wellness in the elementary classroom using an integrated approach. </p></p><p><p><b>Retta R.

Like Mark Twain before him, Vonnegut's reputation and impact on American writing and reading will continue to grow steadily and increase in relevance as new insights are made. Vonnegut was born in 1922 in Indianapolis, and studied at the University of Chicago and the University of Tennessee. In the Second World War, he became a German prisoner of war and was present during the bombing of Dresden. This experience provided inspiration for his most successful and influential novel, Slaughterhouse-Five. Vonnegut &#x2014; admired as much for his views and his &#x201c;Vonnegutisms&#x201d; as for his publications &#x2014; wrote extensively in many forms, including novels, short stories, essays, plays, articles, speeches, and correspondence, some of which was published posthumously.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br><i>The First Amendment<br></i><br>I am a member of what I believe to be the last recognizable generation of full-time, life-time American novelists. We appear to be standing more or less in a row. It was the Great Depression which made us similarly edgy and watchful. It was World War II which lined us up so nicely, whether we were men or women, whether we were ever in uniform or not. It was an era of romantic anarchy in publishing which gave us money and mentors, willy-nilly, when we were young&#x2013;while we learned our craft. Words printed on pages were still the principal form of long-distance communication and stored information in America when we were young.<br><br>No more.<br><br>Nor are there many publishers and editors and agents left who are eager to find some way to get money and other forms of encouragement to young writers who write as clumsily as member of my literary generation did when we started out. The wild and wonderful and expensive guess was made back then that we might acquire some wisdom and learn how to write halfway decently by and by. Writers were needed that much back then.<br><br>It was an amusing and instructive time for writers&#x2013;for hundreds of them.<br><br>Television wrecked the short-story branch of the industry, and now accountants and business school graduates dominate book publishing. They feel that money spent on someone's first novel is good money down a rat hole. They are right. It almost always is.<br><br>So, as I say, I think I belong to America's last generation of novelists. Novelists will come one by one from now on, not in seeming families, and will perhaps write only one or two novels, and let it go at that. Many will have inherited or married money.<br><br>The most influential of my bunch, in my opinion, is still J. D. Salinger, although he has been silent for years. The most promising was perhaps Edward Lewis Wallant, who died so young. And it is my thinking about the death of James Jones two years ago, who was not all that young, who was almost exactly my age, which accounts for the autumnal mood of this book. There have been other reminders of my own mortality, to be sure, but the death of Jones is central&#x2013;perhaps because I see his widow Gloria so often and because he, too, was a self-educated midwesterner, and because he, too, in a major adventure for all of us, which was the Second World War, had been an enlisted man. And let it here be noted that the best-known members of my literary generation, if they wrote about war, almost unanimously despised officers and made heroes of sketchily educated, aggressively unaristocratic enlisted men.<br><br>� � �<br><br>James Jones told me one time that his publisher and Ernest Hemingway's, Charles Scribner's Sons, had once hoped to get Jones and Hemingway together&#x2013;so that they could enjoy each other's company as old warriors.<br><br>Jones declined, by his own account, because he did not regard Hemingway as a fellow soldier. He said Hemingway in wartime was free to come and go from the fighting as he pleased, and to take time off for a fine meal or woman or whatever. Real soldiers, according to Jones, damn well had to stay where they were told, or go where they were told, and eat swill, and take the worst the enemy had to throw at them day after day, week after week.<br><br>� � �<br><br>It may be that the most striking thing about members of my literary generation in retrospect will be that we were allowed to say absolutely anything without fear of punishment. Our American heirs may find it incredible, as most foreigners do right now, that a nation would want to enforce as a law something which sounds more like a dream, which reads as follows:<br><br>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."<br><br>How could a nation with such a law raise its children in an atmosphere of decency? It couldn't&#x2013;it can't. So the law will surely be repealed soon for the sake of children.<br><br>And even now my books, along with books by Bernard Malamud and James Dickey and Joseph Heller and many other first-rate patriots, are regularly thrown out of public-school libraries by school board members, who commonly say that they have not actually read the books, but that they have it on good authority that the books are bad for children.<br><br>� � �<br><br>My novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> was actually burned in a furnace by a school janitor in Drake, North Dakota, on instructions from the school committee there, and the school board made public statements about the unwholesomeness of the book. Even by the standards of Queen Victoria, the only offensive line in th entire novel is this: "Get out of the road, you dumb motherfucker." This is spoken by an American antitank gunner to an unarmed American chaplain's assistant during the Battle of the Bulge in Europe in December 1944, the largest single defeat of American arms (the Confederacy excluded) in history. The chaplain's assistant had attracted enemy fire.<br><br>So on November 16, 1973, I wrote as follows to Charles McCarthy of Drake, North Dakota:<br><br>Dear Mr. McCarthy:<br><br>I am writing to you in your capacity as chairman of the Drake School Board. I am among those American writers whose books have been destroyed in the now famous furnace of your school.<br><br>Certain members of your community have suggested that my work is evil. This is extraordinarily insulting to me. The news from Drake indicates to me that books and writers are very unreal to you people. I am writing this letter to let you know how real I am.<br><br>I want you to know, too, that my publisher and I have done absolutely nothing to exploit the disgusting news from Drake. We are not clapping each other on the back, crowing about all the books we will sell because of the news. We have declined to go on television, have written no fiery letters to editorial pages, have granted no lengthy interviews. We are angered and sickened and saddened. And no copies of this letter have been sent to anybody else. You now hold the only copy in your hands. It is a strictly private letter from me to the people of Drake, who have done so much to damage my reputation in the eyes of their children and then in the eyes of the world. Do you have the courage and ordinary decency to show this letter to the people, or will it, too, be consigned to the fires of your furnace?<br><br>I gather from what I read in the papers and hear on television that you imagine me, and some other writers, too, as being sort of ratlike people who enjoy making money from poisoning the minds of young people. I am in fact a large, strong person, fifty-one years old, who did a lot of farm work as a boy, who is good with tools. I have raised six children, three my own and three adopted. They have all turned out well. Two of them are farmers. I am a combat infantry veteran from World War II, and hold a Purple Heart. I have earned whatever I own by hard work. I have never been arrested or sued for anything. I am so much trusted with young people and by young people that I have served on the faculties of the University of Iowa, Harvard, and the City College of New York. Every year I receive at least a dozen invitations to be commencement speaker at colleges and high schools. My books are probably more widely used in schools than those of any other living American fiction writer.<br><br>If you were to bother to read my books, to behave as educated persons would, you would learn that they are not sexy, and do not argue in favor of wildness of any kind. They beg that people be kinder and more responsible than they often are. It is true that some of the characters speak coarsely. That is because people speak coarsely in real life. Especially soldiers and hardworking men speak coarsely, and even our most sheltered children know that. And we all know, too, that those words really don't damage children much. They didn't damage us when we were young. It was evil deeds and lying that hurt us.<br><br>After I have said all this. I am sure you are still ready to respond, in effect, "Yes, yes&#x2013;but it still remains our right and our responsibility to decide what books our children are going to be made to read in our community." This is surely so. But it is also true that if you exercise that right and fulfill that responsibility in an ignorant, harsh, un-American manner, then people are entitled to call you bad citizens and fools. Even your own children are entitled to call you that.<br><br>I read in the newspaper that your community is mystified by the outcry from all over the country about what you have done. Well, you have discovered that Drake is a part of American civilization, and your fellow Americans can't stand it that you have behaved in such an uncivilized way. Perhaps you will learn from this that books are sacred to free men for very good reasons, and that wars have been fought against nations which hate books and burn them. If you are an American, you must allow all ideas to circulate freely in your community, not merely your own.<br><br>If you and your board are now determined to show that you in fact have wisdom and maturity when you exercise your powers over the eduction of your young, then you should acknowledge that it was a rotten lesson you taught young people in a free society when you denounced and then burned books&#x2013;books you hadn't even read. You should also resolve to expose your children to all sorts of opinions and information, in order that they will be better equipped to make decisions and to survive.<br><br>Again: you have insulted me, and I am a good citizen, and I am very real.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>That was seven years ago. There has so far been no reply. At this very moment, as I write in New York City, <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> has been banned from school libraries not fifty miles from here. A legal battle begun several years ago rages on. The school board in question has found lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment tooth and nail. There is never a shortage anywhere of lawyers eager to attack the First Amendment, as though it were nothing more than a clause in a lease from a crooked slumlord.<br><br>At the start of that particular litigation, on March 24th of 1976, I wrote a comment for the Op-Ed page of the Long Island edition of <i>The New York Times</i>. It went like this:<br><br>A school board has denounced some books again&#x2013;out in Levittown this time. One of the books was mine. I hear about un-American nonsense like this twice a year or so. One time out in North Dakota, the books were actually burned in a furnace. I had a laugh. It was such an ignorant, dumb, superstitious thing to do.<br><br>It was so cowardly, too&#x2013;to make a great show of attacking artifacts. It was like St. George attacking bedspreads and cuckoo clocks.<br><br>Yes, and St. Georges like that seem to get elected or appointed to school committees all the time. They are actually proud of their illiteracry. They imagine that they are somehow celebrating the bicentennial when they boast, as some did in Levittown, that they hadn't actually read the books they banned.<br><br>Such lunks are often the backbone of volunteer fire departments and the United States Infantry and cake sales and so on, and they have been thanked often enough for that. But they have no business supervising the eductions of children in a free society. They are just too bloody stupid.<br><br>Here is how I propose to end book-banning in this country once and for all: Every candidate for school committee should be hooked up to a lie-detector and asked this question: "Have you read a book from start to finish since high school? Or did you even read a book from start to finish in high school?"<br><br>If the truthful answer is "no," then the candidate should be told politely that he cannot get on the school committee and blow off his big bazoo about how books make children crazy.<br><br>Whenever ideas are squashed in this country, literate lovers of the American experiment write careful and intricate explanations of why all ideas must be allowed to live. It is time for them to realize that they are attempting to explain America at its bravest and most optimistic to orangutans.<br><br>From now on, I intend to limit my discourse with dimwitted Savonarolas to this advice: "Have somebody read the First Amendment to the United States Constitution out loud to you, you God damned fool!"<br><br>Well&#x2013;the American Civil Liberties Union or somebody like that will come to the scene of trouble, as they always do. They will explain what is in the Constitution, and to whom it applies.<br><br>They will win.<br><br>And there will be millions who are bewildered and heartbroken by the legal victory, who think some things should never be said&#x2013;especially about religion.<br><br>They are in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br><br>Hi ho.<br><br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<br><br>Why is it so ordinary for American citizens to show such scorn for the First Amendment? I discussed that some at a fund raiser for the American Civil Liberties Union at Sands Point, New York, out on Long Island, on September 16, 1979. The house where I spoke, incidentally, was said to be the model for Gatsby's house in F. Scott Fitzgerald's <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. I saw no reason to doubt the claim.<br><br>I said this in such a setting:<br><br>"I will not speak directly to the ejection of my book <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> from the school libraries of Island Trees. I have a vested interest. I wrote the book, after all, so why wouldn&#x2019;t I argue that it is less repulsive than the school board says?<br><br>"I will speak of Thomas Aquinas instead. I will tell you my dim memories of what he said about the hierarchy of laws on this planet, which was flat at the time. The highest law, he said, was divine law, God's law. Beneath that was natural law, which I suppose would include thunderstorms, and our right to shield our children from poisonous ideas, and so on.<br><br>"And the lowest law was human law.<br><br>"Let me clarify this scheme by comparing its parts to playing cards. Enemies of the Bill of Rights do the same sort of thing all the time, so why shouldn't we? Divine law, then, is an ace. Natural law is a king. The Bill of Rights is a lousy queen.<br><br>"The Thomist hierarchy of laws is so far from being ridiculous that I have never met anybody who did not believe in it right down to the marrow of his or her bones. Everybody knows that there are laws with more grandeur than those which are printed in our statute books. The big trouble is that there is so little agreement as to how those grander laws are worded.

Selling in the millions each year for the past six decades, comic books have figured prominently in the childhoods of most Americans alive today. In <i>Comic Book Nation</i>, Bradford W. Wright offers an engaging, illuminating, and often provocative history of the comic book industry within the context of twentieth-century American society.</p><p>From Batman's Depression-era battles against corrupt local politicians and Captain America's one-man war against Nazi Germany to Iron Man's Cold War exploits in Vietnam and Spider-Man's confrontations with student protestors and drug use in the early 1970s, comic books have continually reflected the national mood, as Wright's imaginative reading of thousands of titles from the 1930s to the 1980s makes clear. In every genre&#x2015;superhero, war, romance, crime, and horror comic books&#x2015;Wright finds that writers and illustrators used the medium to address a variety of serious issues, including racism, economic injustice, fascism, the threat of nuclear war, drug abuse, and teenage alienation. At the same time, xenophobic wartime series proved that comic books could be as reactionary as any medium.</p><p>Wright's lively study also focuses on the role comic books played in transforming children and adolescents into consumers; the industry's ingenious efforts to market their products to legions of young but savvy fans; the efforts of parents, politicians, religious organizations, civic groups, and child psychologists like Dr. Fredric Wertham (whose 1954 book <i>Seduction of the Innocent,</i> a salacious expos� of the medium's violence and sexual content, led to U.S. Senate hearings) to link juvenile delinquency to comic books and impose censorship on the industry; and the changing economics of comic book publishing over the course of the century. For the paperback edition, Wright has written a new postscript that details industry developments in the late 1990s and the response of comic artists to the tragedy of 9/11. <i>Comic Book Nation</i> is at once a serious study of popular culture and an entertaining look at an enduring American art form.</p></p><p>"Pow! Bam! Crash! Analysis! This insightful and highly entertaining political and cultural history [offers] an intelligent study not only of comics but of shifting attitudes toward popular culture, children, violence, patriotism, and America itself."&#x2014;Publishers Weekly, Starred Review <p>"Congratulations to Bradford W. Wright for penning one of the most comprehensive and readable accounts of the pervasive effect that comic books have had upon generations of readers throughout America, and indeed&#x2014;the world."&#x2014;Stan Lee</p><p><b>Bradford W.

Everyone on the scene seems to have a motive, not to mention the wherewithal to commit murder, and alibis that simply don't hold up. The inspector is sorely tried by a wide variety of suspects, including the neglected widow, the neighbor who's in love with her, her resentful daughter, and a patently phony Russian prince preying on the widow's emotional vulnerability and social aspirations. And then there's the blackmail plot that may?or may not?be at the heart of the case?</p><p>PRAISE FOR GEORGETTE HEYER: </p><p><em>"Our Georgette Heyer display of the Sourcebooks reprints has been a huge success, not only to those early fans like myself, but to many new readers who appreciate her style and wit."</em><br><strong>Nancy Olson, Quail Ridge Books, Raleigh, NC</strong></p><p><em>"Reading Georgette Heyer is the next best thing to reading Jane Austen."</em><br><strong>Publishers Weekly</strong></p><p><em>"Wonderful characters, elegant, witty writing, perfect period detail, and rapturously romantic. Georgette Heyer achieves what the rest of us only aspire to."</em> <br><strong>Katie Fforde </strong></p></p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known also as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a mining engineer, and they had one son together, Richard.<p><b>One</b></p> <p>The Prince is coming by the one-forty-five. That means he'll be here in time for tea. Well, I do call that nice!'</p> <p>No answer being made to this remark, the lady at the head of the table repeated it, adding: &#x2018;I'm sure you'll like him. He's such a gentleman, if you know what I mean.'</p> <p>Miss Cliffe raised her eyes from her own correspondence. &#x2018;Sorry, Aunt Ermyntrude: I wasn't attending. The Prince oh yes! Then the big car will be wanted to meet the train. I'll see to it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, do, dearie.' Mrs Carter restored the Prince's letter to its envelope, and stretched out a plump arm towards the toast-rack. She was a large woman, who had enjoyed, in youth, the advantages of golden hair and a pink-and-white complexion. Time had committed some ravages with both these adjuncts, but a lavish use of peroxide and the productions of a famous beauty specialist really worked wonders. If the gold of Ermyntrude's carefully waved hair was a trifle metallic, the colour in her cheeks was all and more than it had ever been. Artificial light was kinder to her than the daylight, but she never allowed this tiresome fact to worry her, applying her rouge each morning with a lavish yet skilled hand which recalled the days when she had adorned the front row of the chorus; and touching up her lashes with mascara, or (in her more dashing moments) with a species of vivid blue that was supposed to deepen the perfectly natural blue of her eyes.</p> <p>The exigencies of this facial toilet apparently exhausted her matutinal energy, for she never put on her corsets until fortified by breakfast, and invariably appeared in the dining-room in a robe of silk and lace which she referred to as her n�glig�. Mary Cliffe, who had never been able to accustom herself to the sight of Ermyntrude's flowing sleeves trailing negligently across the butter-dishes, and occasionally, if Ermyntrude were more than usually careless, dipping into her coffee, had once suggested, with perfect tact, that she really ought to stay in bed for breakfast. But Ermyntrude was of a cheerful and a sociable disposition, and liked to preside over the breakfast-table, and to discover what were her family's plans for the day.</p> <p>Mary Cliffe, who addressed her by the title of aunt, was not, in fact, her niece, but the cousin, and ward, of her husband, Wallis Carter. She was a good-looking young woman in the early twenties, with a great deal of common sense, and a tidiness of mind which years of association with Wally Carter had only served to strengthen. She was fond of Wally, in a mild way, but she was not in the least blind to his faults, and had not suffered even a small pang of jealousy when, five years before, he had, rather surprisingly, married Ermyntrude Fanshawe. The possession of a small but securely tied-up income of her own had ensured her education at a respectable boarding-school, but her holidays, owing to Wally's nomadic tendencies and frequent insolvencies, had been spent in a succession of dingy boarding-houses, and enlivened only by the calls of creditors, and the recurrent dread that Wally would succumb to the attractions of one or other of his landladies. When, during a brief period of comparative affluence, he had patronised a large hotel at a fashionable watering-place, and had had the luck to captivate Ermyntrude Fanshawe, who was an extremely rich widow, Mary, with her customary good sense, had regarded his marriage as providential. Ermyntrude was undoubtedly flamboyant, and very often vulgar, but she was good-natured, and extremely generous, and so far from resenting the existence of her husband's young ward, behaved to her with the utmost kindness, and would not hear of her leaving Wally's roof to earn her own living. If Mary wanted to work, she said, she could act as her secretary at Palings, and perhaps help with the housekeeping. &#x2018;Besides, dearie, you'll be a real nice companion for my Vicky,' she added.</p> <p>This had seemed to Mary to be a fair arrangement, although, when she met Vicky Fanshawe, a precocious schoolgirl, five years her junior, she could not feel that they were destined to become soul-mates.</p> <p>Vicky, however, was being educated, at immense expense, first at a fashionable school on the south coast of England, and later at a still more fashionable finishing-school in Switzerland. During the last two years, she had spent her holidays abroad with Ermyntrude, so that Mary had hardly encountered her. Her education was now considered to be completed, and she was living at home, a source of pride and joy to her mother, but not precisely an ideal companion for Mary, who was alternately amused and exasperated by her.</p> <p>She reflected, on this warm September morning, that the presence of a Russian prince in the house would be productive of all Vicky's most tiresome antics, and inquired in tones of foreboding whether the Prince were young.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I wouldn't say young,' replied Ermyntrude, helping herself to marmalade. &#x2018;He's at what I call the right age, if you know what I mean. You never saw anyone so distinguished and then his manners! Well, you don't meet with such polish in England, not that I'm one to run down my own country, but there it is.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I don't like Russians much,' said Mary perversely. &#x2018;They always seem to talk so much and do so little.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You shouldn't be narrow-minded, dear. Besides, he isn't actually a Russian, as I've told you a dozen times. He's a Georgian he used to have a lovely estate in the Caucasus, which is somewhere near the Black Sea, I believe.'</p> <p>At this moment the door opened, and Wally Carter came into the room. He was a medium-sized man, who had been good-looking in youth, but who had run rather badly to seed. His blue eyes were inclined to be bloodshot, and his mouth, under a drooping moustache, sagged a little. In the days when he had courted Ermyntrude, his fondness for strong liquor had not made him quite careless of appearances, but five years spent in opulent circumstances had caused him to deteriorate lamentably. He was naturally slovenly, and his clothes never seemed to fit him, nor his hair to be properly brushed. He was generally amiable, but grumbled a good deal, not in any bad-tempered spirit, but in a gently complaining way to which none of his family paid the slightest heed.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here you are, then!' said his wife, by way of greeting. &#x2018;Touch the bell, Mary, there's a love! We couldn't have had a better day, could we, Wally? Though, of course, as I always say, to see Palings at its best you ought to see it when the rhododendrons are out.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Who wants to see it?' inquired Wally, casting a lack-lustre glance towards the window.</p> <p>&#x2018;Now, Wally! As though you didn't know as well as I do that the Prince is coming today!'</p> <p>This reminder seemed to set the seal to Wally's dissatisfaction. He lowered the newspaper behind which he had entrenched himself. &#x2018;Not that fellow you picked up at Antibes?' he said.</p> <p>A spark of anger gleamed in Ermyntrude's eye. &#x2018;I don't see that you've any call to be vulgar. I should hope I didn't go picking up men at my time of life! Alexis was introduced to me by Lady Fisher, I'll have you know.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Alexis!' ejaculated Wally. &#x2018;You needn't think I'm going to go about calling the fellow by a silly name like that, because I'm not.'</p> <p>&#x2018;You'll call him Prince Varasashvili, and that's all there is to it,' said Ermyntrude tartly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, I won't. For one thing, I don't like it, and for another, I couldn't remember it not that I want to, because I don't. And if you take my advice, you'll be careful how you say it. If you start introducing this fellow as Prince Varasash whatever-it-is, you'll have people saying you've been mixing your drinks.'</p> <p>&#x2018;I must say it's a bit of a tongue-twister,' remarked Mary. &#x2018;You'll have to write it down for me, Aunt Ermy.'</p> <p>&#x2018;It'll be quite all right if you just call him Prince,' said Ermyntrude kindly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if that's your idea of quite all right it isn't mine,' said Wally. &#x2018;Nice fool you'll look when you say Prince, and find the poor old dog wagging his tail at you.'</p> <p>This aspect of the situation struck Ermyntrude most forcibly. &#x2018;I hadn't thought of that,' she admitted. &#x2018;I must say, it does make things a bit awkward. I mean, you know what Prince is! It would be awful if I went and said, "Get off that chair, Prince," as I don't doubt I will do, thanks to the way you spoil that dog, Wally, and Alexis thought I was speaking to him. Oh well, Prince will have to be tied up, that's all.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Now, that's one thing I won't put up with,' said Wally. &#x2018;It's little enough I ever ask, but have my poor old dog tied up for the sake of a Russian prince I don't know and don't want to know, I won't. If you'd asked me before inviting the fellow, I should have said don't, because I don't like foreigners; but, as usual, no one consulted me.'</p> <p>Ermyntrude looked concerned. &#x2018;Well, I'm sorry you're so set against Alexis, Wally, but honestly he doesn't speak foreign.'</p> <p>Wally paid not the slightest heed to this, but said: &#x2018;A set of wasters, that's what those White Russians are. I'm not surprised they had a revolution. Serves them right! What was this chap of yours doing at Antibes? You needn't tell me! Living on some rich woman, that's what he was doing!' He found that his ward had raised her eyes quickly to his face, and was flushing rather uncomfortably, and added: &#x2018;Yes, I know what you're thinking, but I shall be a wealthy man one of these days, so the cases aren't the same. When my Aunt Clara dies, I shall pay Ermyntrude back every penny.'</p> <p>Mary made no remark. Wally's Aunt Clara, who had been an inmate for the past ten years of a Home for Mentally Deficients, was well known to her by repute, having served Wally as an excuse for his various extravagances ever since she could remember.</p> <p>Ermyntrude gave a chuckle. &#x2018;Yes, we all know about this precious Aunt Clara of yours, dearie. All I can say is, I hope you may get her money, not that there's any question of paying back between us, because there isn't; and if you're trying to cast it up at me that I grudge you anything, you know I don't grudge a penny, except for what you squander on things which we won't mention.'</p> <p>This sinister reference, accompanied as it was by a rising note in his wife's voice, quelled Wally. He hastily passed his cup to her for more coffee, and greeted, with frank relief, the sudden and tempestuous entrance of his stepdaughter.</p> <p>This damsel came into the room on a wave of dogs. Two cocker spaniels, Ermyntrude's Pekinese, and an overgrown Borzoi cavorted about her, and since one of the cockers had apparently been in the river, a strong aroma of dog at once pervaded the room.</p> <p>&#x2018;The Sports Girl!' remarked Mary, casting an experienced eye over Vicky's costume.</p> <p>This consisted of a pair of slacks, an Aertex shirt, and sandals which displayed two rows of reddened toe-nails.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, darling, not the spaniels! Oh, if Prince hasn't been in the water again!' exclaimed Ermyntrude distressfully.</p> <p>&#x2018;Poor sweets!' Vicky crooned, ejecting them from the room. &#x2018;Lovely, lovely pets, not now! Lie down, Roy! Good Roy, lie down!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What's this idea of bringing a pack of dogs in to breakfast?' demanded Wally, repulsing the advances of the Borzoi. &#x2018;Lie down, will you? You might as well try to eat in a damned menagerie!' He added, after a glance at Vicky's costume: &#x2018;What's more, it puts me off my food to see you in that get-up. I don't know why your mother allows it.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, let her alone, Wally!' said Ermyntrude. &#x2018;I'm sure she looks as pretty as paint, whatever she wears. Not but what I don't care for trousers myself. Time and again when I've seen some fat creature waddling about in them, I've thought to myself, well, my girl, if you could see your own bottom you'd soon change into a skirt.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Darling! I practically haven't got a bottom!' protested Vicky, sliding into her place opposite to Mary.</p> <p>&#x2018;Nor you have, ducky. That's one way you don't take after me!'</p> <p>Vicky smiled abstractedly, and began to read her letters, while her mother sat surveying her with fond admiration.</p> <p>She was indeed a very pretty girl, with pale corn-coloured hair, which she wore rather long, and curled into a thick bush of ringlets at the base of her neck; and large blue eyes that gazed innocently forth from between darkened lashes. Even the ruthless plucking of her eyebrows, and the pencilling of improbable arches perceptibly higher than the shadows of the original brows, failed to ruin her beauty. Her complexion varied in accordance with her mood, or her costume, but she had no need of powder to whiten a naturally fair skin.</p> <p>&#x2018;I suppose you know about this prince coming to stay?' said Wally, in a grumbling tone. &#x2018;What your mother wants with him I don't know, though I dare say you're as bad as she is, and think there's something fine about having a prince in the house.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I think it's lovely!' Vicky said.</p> <p>This artless response disgusted Wally so much that he relapsed into silence.</p> <p>Ermyntrude had slit open another letter, and suddenly exclaimed &#x2018;Ah!' in an exultant tone. A triumphant smile curled her lips. &#x2018;There's nothing like a prince!' she said simply. &#x2018;The Derings have accepted!'</p> <p>Even Wally seemed pleased by this announcement, but he said, with a glance in Mary's direction, that he didn't think the Prince had anything to do with it. &#x2018;I wouldn't mind betting young Bering's home,' he said.</p> <p>Mary coloured, but replied calmly: &#x2018;I told you he was, yesterday.'</p> <p>Vicky emerged from the clouds of some apparently beatific dream to inquire: &#x2018;Who is he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;He's an old friend of Mary's,' said Wally.</p> <p>&#x2018;The boy-friend?' asked Vicky, interested.</p> <p>&#x2018;No, not the boy-friend,' said Mary. &#x2018;His people live at the Manor, and I've known him ever since we came to live here. He's a Chancery barrister. You must remember him, surely!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, but he sounds frightfully dull,' said Vicky.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, he's a very nice young fellow,' said Wally. &#x2018;And if he wants to marry Mary I shall make no objection. No objection at all. What's more, I shall leave her all my money.'</p> <p>&#x2018;When you get it,' said Ermyntrude, with a chuckle. &#x2018;I'm sure I hope he will ask Mary to marry him, because it would be what I call a good match, and what's more, the man that gets you, my dear, will be very lucky, whatever his people may say.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Thank you!' said Mary. &#x2018;But as he hasn't asked me to marry him, I don't think we need worry about what his people would say, Aunt Ermy.' Conscious of her heightened colour, she made haste to change the subject, looking across the table at Vicky, and saying: &#x2018;By the way, what got you out of bed so bright and early this morning? I heard you carolling in the bath at an ungodly hour.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I went out to see if I could get a rabbit!'</p> <p>Mary's lips twitched. &#x2018;I thought this was a Sports-Girl Day! Don't tell me you weren't wearing sandals and painted toe-nails, because it would spoil the whole picture for me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I was!' said Vicky, opening her eyes very wide.</p> <p>&#x2018;You must have looked a treat!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, I do think I looked rather nice,' Vicky agreed wholeheartedly.</p> <p>&#x2018;Did you shoot anything?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh yes, very nearly!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's where you take after your father, ducky,' said Ermyntrude. &#x2018;I never knew such a man for sport! Three times he went to Africa, big-game shooting. That was before he met me, of course.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, if you call missing rabbits taking after her father, I don't,' remarked Wally. &#x2018;As far as I can make out, her father never missed anything. It's a great pity he didn't, if you ask me, for if he had perhaps I shouldn't have had to live in a house full of bits of wild animals.

America's third president regarded Jesus as a moral guide rather than a divinity, and in <i>The Jefferson Bible,</i> he highlights Christ's ethical teachings from the Gospels. Discarding the scriptures' supernatural elements and dogma, this volume reflects the deist view of religion, focusing on Jesus' message of absolute love and service.<br>Jefferson undertook his self-appointed task in 1794, consulting not only the King James Bible but also Greek, French, and Latin versions. He selected verses from the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and arranged them in chronological order to form a single narrative. Although Jefferson shared his interpretation with friends and family, he declined to publish it, in keeping with his conviction that religion is a private matter &#x2014; and also to avoid providing his political enemies with ammunition. Not until the turn of the twentieth century did the book appear in print, when it became a tradition to present it to new members of Congress. Unique and influential, this volume reflects not only the thinking of one of the nation's most brilliant statesmen, but also the ideology of the Enlightenment era.</p><p>Akashic Books presents a thought-provoking series of early writings from United States Presidents, starting this season with George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, and moving chronologically forward. Each slim book offers an introduction and additional commentary by a groundbreaking contemporary writer. This series is unlike any other Presidential commentaries in print, and is characterized by a critical viewpoint that will provide a counterpoint to the more staid analyses that have traditionally accompanied Presidential writings.Thomas Jefferson believed that the pure-principled teachings of Jesus should have been separated from the dogma and abuse of organized religion of the day. This led him to recast, by cutting and pasting from the gospels, a new narrative of the life and teachings of Jesus.</p><h2>Kinn&#39;s The Medical Assistant</h2><p><p>More than any other product on the market, the most successful Medical Assistants begin their careers with <b><i>Kinn</i>.</b> Trusted for more than 60 years, <b>Kinn's The Medical Assistant: An Applied Learning Approach, 14th Edition, </b>teaches you real-world administrative and clinical skills essential for a career in the modern medical office - always with a focus on application through unfolding case scenarios, critical thinking questions, procedure videos, and interactive exercises.

Hooked on war, genuflecting to big donors, in thrall to discredited economic theories and utterly bereft of a moral compass, America&#x2019;s governing classes are selling their souls to entrenched interest while our bridges collapse, wages, stagnate, and our water is increasingly undrinkable. <br><br>Drawing on sinsights gleaned over three decades on Capitol Hill, much of it on the Budget Committee, Lofgren paints a gripping portrait of the dismal swamp on the Potomac and the revolution it will take to reclaim our government and set us back on course.</p><p>Mike Lofgren is <i>The</i> <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of <i>The Party Is Over</i>.

Bill&#x2019;s suggestion to write an essay on the Deep State was the acorn from which the oak took root. Gratitude is owed to Chuck Spinney and Brian O&#x2019;Malley, two firm friends and former fellow travelers with me in the government. Their observations over the years helped me crystallize and polish the concept of the Deep State. Thanks also to Andrew Cockburn, Ray McGovern, Tom Drake, Winslow Wheeler, Andrew Feinstein, and Bill Binney for their valuable assistance at critical stages. To former colleagues and bosses who provided me with an endless stock of practical knowledge about the way government really works: well, you know who you are! In hindsight, all my governmental experiences were enlightening, if not always as edifying as a Parson Weems fable at the time they actually occurred. Joy de Menil, the editor of this book, worked tirelessly with me to structure the narrative into a coherent whole. Bridget Matzie, my agent, was an unwavering supporter throughout the project. And, of course, none of this would have been possible without a loving and totally supportive family: Alisa, Laura, and Eric.</p><p></p><p></p><p>INTRODUCTION</p><p>For twenty-eight years I was a congressional employee with an interesting and challenging but by no means remarkable career on Capitol Hill as a staff member and national defense analyst for the House and Senate budget committees. I began my tenure as a mainstream Republican in the early days of the Reagan presidency. By the end of my career I considered myself a resolute nonpartisan, and increasingly viewed all political ideologies as mental and emotional crutches, or substitute religions: for leaders, a means of manipulating attitudes and behaviors; for the rank and file, a lazy surrogate for problem solving and a way of fulfilling the craving to belong to something bigger than oneself.</p><p>My first perception of this ideological syndrome came in the mid-1990s, when Republicans had taken over the majority in the House of Representatives for the first time in forty years. It was an exciting time, to be sure, but a tumultuous one. Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, the Robespierre of the Republican revolution, employed chaos, polarization, and scapegoating as the means of carrying out a divide-and-rule strategy. It worked for a time, but I saw in retrospect that it was a technique that crippled the legislative branch so that it could no longer work effectively. It did not help that many Republican congressmen were too busy lasciviously ogling the sordid details of Kenneth Starr&#x2019;s report on the Monica Lewinsky affair to notice that an obscure extremist group called al-Qaeda had blown up two of our embassies in Africa.</p><p>The real wake-up call for me came during that surreal period between the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. If there was any point in our post&#x2013;World War II history that called for careful analysis of the facts and rational responses that would serve the nation&#x2019;s long-term security interests, this was surely it.</p><p>Instead, a clique of neoconservative ideologues both inside and outside the George W. Bush administration, abetted at every step by the mainstream news media, acted as carnival barkers for the most destructive and self-defeating policies since Vietnam, and maybe since the eve of the Civil War. A majority of politicians on Capitol Hill, along with a sizable portion of the American people, ambled around like sleepwalkers on the edge of a precipice, unaware of the danger the ideologues were luring them into. When the House Administration Committee instructed the institution&#x2019;s cafeterias to rename French fries &#x201c;freedom fries&#x201d; because the government in Paris stubbornly remained unmesmerized by the Bush administration&#x2019;s arguments for war in the Middle East, I recognized that the People&#x2019;s House had hit intellectual rock bottom.</p><p>Still, I told whoever would listen that the &#x201c;slam dunk&#x201d; evidence of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s weapons of mass destruction was weak and that by invading Iraq the United States might be purchasing its very own West Bank on steroids&#x2014;not that my objections changed anyone&#x2019;s mind. Later, when the invoices began to pile up&#x2014;the total bill for Iraq summed up to a nice, round one trillion dollars, excluding debt service&#x2014;I attempted, from my position on the Budget Committee, to reconcile this extravagance, as much as the numbers would allow, with the rote statements of representatives and senators that deficit spending was a sign of an out-of-control government and a national moral blot that would impoverish our children.</p><p>Parallel to these developments, the American economy was mutating into a casino with a tilted wheel. Ably assisted by politicians, whom I began to see less and less as leaders and more and more as corporate errand boys, the titans of Wall Street constructed a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose economic system based on Ponzi schemes, asset stripping, and rent extraction. The inevitable result was the economic meltdown of 2008. The eventual solution to that catastrophe was not national reconstruction but a bailout of the financial institutions that had caused the disaster in the first place. They soon returned to record profitability and market dominance as the rest of the country experienced the slowest recovery since the Great Depression.</p><p>The twin shocks of 9/11 and the Great Recession seem mentally to have unhinged a portion of the American people and much of the political class. The following years were consumed by crazy arguments about the president&#x2019;s birth certificate, death panels, and voters shouting that the government must get its hands off their government-provided Medicare. By 2011, when a new crop of Tea Party freshmen had taken their seats in Congress and announced that their first priority was to drive the country into a sovereign debt default, I decided I&#x2019;d had enough. The circus was being run from the monkey cage, and it was time to move on.</p><p>Back in private life, I wrote about the rightward lurch of the Republican Party and the intractable gridlock on the Hill in a book titled <i>The Party Is Over: How Republicans Went Crazy, Democrats Became Useless, and the Middle Class Got Shafted. </i>Perhaps I can claim a modest amount of credit for helping to launch the now-thriving cottage industry of political pundits noticing the nuttiness of the present-day Party of Lincoln with the mortified distaste of an Anglican bishop confronted by a tribe of cannibals. That said, I was hardly ready to launch myself into the arms of the Party of Jefferson and Jackson. That crowd had serious problems, too.</p><p>Shortly after finishing the book, I began to feel that I had dealt with the symptoms&#x2014;lurid symptoms, to be sure&#x2014;rather than fundamental causes. Diseases always manifest themselves as symptoms, but these should not be confused with the underlying cause of the malady. America&#x2019;s politics were broken, but so were its economic engine and its supposedly bipartisan foreign policy. Social indicators of human development such as life expectancy and maternal mortality showed that America was slipping in comparison with other developed countries. Economic inequality was growing. Infrastructure was getting rickety. Educational policy was confused and ineffectual. The Tea Party, as gaudy and irrational as its anger might be, was merely one among several warning signs of a deep-seated dysfunction in the way American society was run at the very top.</p><p>Anyone who has spent time on Capitol Hill will occasionally get the feeling when watching debates in the House or Senate chambers that he or she is seeing a kind of marionette theater, with members of Congress reading carefully vetted talking points about prefabricated issues. This impression was particularly strong both in the run-up to the Iraq War and later, during the mock deliberations over funding that ongoing debacle. While the public is now aware of the disproportionate influence of powerful corporations over Washington, best exemplified by the judicial travesty known as the <i>Citizens United</i> decision, few fully appreciate that the United States has in the last several decades gradually undergone a process first identified by Aristotle and later championed by Machiavelli that the journalist Edward Peter Garrett described in the 1930s as a &#x201c;revolution within the form.&#x201d; Our venerable institutions of government have outwardly remained the same, but they have grown more and more resistant to the popular will as they have become hardwired into a corporate and private influence network with almost unlimited cash to enforce its will.</p><p>Even as commentators decry a broken government that cannot marshal the money, the will, or the competence to repair our roads and bridges, heal our war veterans, or even roll out a health care website, there is always enough money and will, and maybe just a bare minimum of competence, to overthrow foreign governments, fight the longest war in U.S. history, and conduct dragnet surveillance over the entire surface of the planet.</p><p>This paradox of penury and dysfunction on the one hand and unlimited wealth and seeming omnipotence on the other is replicated outside of government as well. By every international metric of health and living standards, the rural counties of southern West Virginia and eastern Kentucky qualify as third-world. So do large areas of Detroit, Cleveland, Camden, Gary, and many other American cities. At the same time, wealth beyond computation, almost beyond imagining, piles up in the money center of New York and the technology hub of Palo Alto. It piles up long enough to purchase a $95,000 truffle, a $38 million vintage Ferrari GTO, or a $179 million Picasso before the balance finds its way to an offshore hiding place.</p><p>These paradoxes, both within the government and within the ostensibly private economy, are related. They are symptoms of a shadow government ruling the United States that pays little heed to the plain words of the Constitution. Its governing philosophy profoundly influences foreign and national security policy and such domestic matters as spending priorities, trade, investment, income inequality, privatization of government services, media presentation of news, and the whole meaning and worth of citizens&#x2019; participation in their government.</p><p>I have come to call this shadow government the Deep State. The term was actually coined in Turkey, and is said to be a system composed of high-level elements within the intelligence services, military, security, judiciary, and organized crime. In John le Carr�&#x2019;s recent novel <i>A Delicate Truth,</i> a character in the book describes the Deep State as &#x201c;the ever-expanding circle of non-governmental insiders from banking, industry and commerce who were cleared for highly classified information denied to large swathes of Whitehall and Westminster.&#x201d; I use the term to mean a hybrid association of key elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States with only limited reference to the consent of the governed as normally expressed through elections.</p><p>The Deep State is the big story of our time. It is the red thread that runs through the war on terrorism and the militarization of foreign policy, the financialization and deindustrialization of the American economy, the rise of a plutocratic social structure that has given us the most unequal society in almost a century, and the political dysfunction that has paralyzed day-to-day governance.</p><p>Edward Snowden&#x2019;s June 2013 exposure of the pervasiveness of the National Security Agency&#x2019;s surveillance has partially awakened a Congress that was asleep at the switch and has ignited a national debate about who is really in charge of our government. At the same time, a few politicians, most notably Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are beginning to argue that the American economy is rigged. But these isolated cases have not provided a framework for understanding the extent of the shadow government, how it arose, the interactions of its various parts, and the extent to which it influences and controls the leaders whom we think we choose in elections. This book, based in large part on my experiences and observations while in public service, aims to provide that framework.</p><p>My reflection on our shadow system of government has come only after my retirement in 2011 and my physical withdrawal from Washington, D.C., proper and the institutions located there. Unlike the vast majority of Capitol Hill strivers who leave the place for greener pastures, I had no desire to join a lobbying shop, trade association, think tank, or consultancy. But I did have a need to see in perspective the events I had witnessed, and I came to realize that the nation&#x2019;s capital, where I lived and worked for more than half my lifetime, has its own peculiar ecology.</p><p>To look upon Washington once again with fresh eyes, I sometimes feel as Darwin must have when he first set foot on the Galapagos Islands. From the Pentagon to K Street, and from the contractor cube farms in Crystal City to the public policy foundations along Massachusetts Avenue, the terrain and its people are exotic and well worth examining in a scientific manner. The official United States government has its capital there, and so does our state within a state. To describe them in the language of physics, they coexist in the same way it is possible for two subatomic particles to coexist in an entangled quantum state. The characteristics of each particle, or each governmental structure, cannot fully be described independently; instead, we must find a way to describe the system as a whole.</p><p></p><p></p><p>1</p><p>BELTWAYLAND</p><p>Rome lived on its principal till ruin stared it in the face.

The authors always make the effort to stay up to date and incorporate the latest ideas, and students find their trawl through 20th century criminological theory the most accessible and informative. In each chapter there is a good balance of discussion and standard critiques, which students find useful for their essays and dissertations." Author: Steve Hall<br><br>"The overall organization of the book is very good &#x2013; this follows a logical pattern of development in relation to not only the historical development of theory, but also the process through which subsequent theories have built on previous frameworks. As a result, it is quite clear how theories and blocks of theory &#x2018;fit together&#x2019;." Author: Tony Murphy<br><br>"Lilly et al is used on the modules as a recommended text. The text was chosen as it covers major theories in a clear and accessible manner to undergraduates. The strength of the book is it gives adequate consideration to the major theories we wish to cover in the modules many other theory books skip adequate consideration of scientific theory (ie chapter 2)." Author: Ruth Penfold- Mounce<br><br>"Indeed, a major strength of the Lilly et al. text is that it provides a succinct explanation of the theories that is easily understood by students." Author: Jennifer Wareham<br><br>"The depth of coverage, the accessible writing style, and the infusion of personal context material were all leading factors motivating my decision to use the Lilly text." Author: James Barnes<br><br>"I do use Lilly, Criminological Theory for CRIM 4321 because it provides a comprehensive collections of major criminological theories that are presented in a straight forward manner in a text that is "student friendly."&nbsp; By this I mean that the information is both challenging but also in a format that is easy to read and comprehend." Author: Michael S. Proctor<br><br>"I assigned Lilly, Cullen, and Ball in this course. Being a 5th edition title, it is a culmination of the hard work and dedication of the authors to continue to update a well crafted text.&nbsp; The benefits of this book is that it explains the social and political events which led to the development and popularity of each theory. This allows students to grasp the somewhat discordant assumptions criminologists made over the years and better understand the casual order of each theory. The authors have done a masterful job of framing years of accumulated criminological theory into an approachable format." Author: Richard Lemke<br><br>"In terms of readability, the 5th edition of Lilly is superior to Vold and superior in terms of coverage as well.&nbsp; Also, I really like the contextual information provided with each theory as well as the implications of each theory, this is much better than Vold." Author: George Eichenberg<br><br>"The strength of the Lilly text (compared to Siegel&#x2019;s) is that it puts events and theories in historical perspective and connects them with the individual lives of the key theorists and the larger sociopolitical context. I also like that the Lilly text assesses the empirical validity of each currently relevant theory and links theories with policies based on these."

Feynman's contributions to twentieth-century physics, but few realize how engaged he was with the world around him how deeply and thoughtfully he considered the religious, political, and social issues of his day. Now, a wonderful book based on a previously unpublished, three-part public lecture he gave at the University of Washington in 1963 shows us this other side of Feynman, as he expounds on the inherent conflict between science and religion, people's distrust of politicians, and our universal fascination with flying saucers, faith healing, and mental telepathy. Here we see Feynman in top form: nearly bursting into a Navajo war chant, then pressing for an overhaul of the English language (if you want to know why Johnny can't read, just look at the spelling of friend&#x201d;); and, finally, ruminating on the death of his first wife from tuberculosis. This is quintessential Feynman reflective, amusing, and ever enlightening.</p><p>In this series of lectures originally given in 1963, which remained unpublished during Richard Feynman's lifetime, the Nobel-winning physicist thinks aloud on several "meta"--questions of science. What is the nature of the tension between science and religious faith? Why does uncertainty play such a crucial role in the scientific imagination? Is this <i>really</i> a scientific age?<p> Marked by Feynman's characteristic combination of rationality and humor, these lectures provide an intimate glimpse at the man behind the legend. "In case you are beginning to believe," he says at the start of his final lecture, "that some of the things I said before are true because I am a scientist and according to the brochure that you get I won some awards and so forth, instead of your looking at the ideas themselves and judging them directly...I will get rid of that tonight. I dedicate this lecture to showing what ridiculous conclusions and rare statements such a man as myself can make." Rare, perhaps. Irreverent, sure. But ridiculous? Not even close.</p><b>How I Found <i>The Meaning of It All</i></b> <p> One day in June of 1997, I was combing through the Feynman archives in the basement of CalTech. My goal was to see what unpublished gems might lie in the midst of the paper relics stored there since, several years earlier, Addison Wesley Longman's General Publishing Group had signed an agreement with Richard P. Feynman's heirs for the exclusive right to publish material from his Nachlass.</p><p> After days of poring through Feynman's handwritten equations, letters, postcards, lecture notes, and other miscellany, I came across a manuscript transcribed from three public lectures (part of the University of Washington's John Danz Memorial Lecture Series), entitled "A Scientist Looks at Society," that Feynman gave in April of 1963. For although Feynman had not yet won the greatest scientific accolade of our time, the Nobel Prize, nor had yet published his bestselling autobiography, <i>Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!</i>, he was already widely known for his remarkable insight into the laws of nature, for his extraordinary teaching ability, and for his famous three-volume textbook, <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>. By 1963, Feynman was a much sought after public speaker. </p><p> My initial delight after reading these lectures was overshadowed by the nagging fear that they had already been published somewhere. Here was Feynman on science, on society, on religion, on peace and war, on all the concerns of the modern citizen-scientist--surely someone had published this intimate look at the personal thoughts of this most respected figure! And indeed, the same folder disclosed the information that, like the previous Danz Lectures delivered by such luminaries as Fred Hoyle, the resulting manuscript would be published by the University of Washington Press in book form. </p><p> Curiously, though, the Feynman bibliography did not list any such publication, nor did Books in Print; nor did Feynman's heirs have any record of the book having been published. Finally, I reached the Press's editor, Emily Pascal (who ironically had been the series editor in 1963 when Feynman had originally given the lectures), who confirmed that the book had never been published. Not only had Feynman not signed the agreement, but he lost interest in the project after editing only the first lecture! Typical Feynman: after completing a project or lecture, he often lost interest in it; his fertile but impatient mind was already off and running after the next "in-te-rest-ing" problem. But what an exciting discovery for Feynman fans, 35 years later! </p><p> I quickly consulted with Feynman's heirs, and we signed the publishing agreement for these wonderful, prophetic, and insightful lectures, renamed <i>The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen Scientist</i>.

A &#x201c;spirit photographer,&#x201d; William Mumler took portrait photographs that featured the ghostly presence of a lost loved one alongside the living subject. Mumler was a sensation: The affluent and influential came calling, including Mary Todd Lincoln, who arrived at his studio in disguise amidst rumors of s�ances in the White House.&nbsp;<br><br> Peter Manseau brilliantly captures a nation wracked with grief and hungry for proof of the existence of ghosts and for contact with their dead husbands and sons. It took a circus-like trial of Mumler on fraud charges, starring P. T. Barnum for the prosecution, to expose a fault line of doubt and manipulation. And even then, the judge sided with the defense&#x2014;nobody ever solved the mystery of his spirit photography. This forgotten puzzle offers a vivid snapshot of America at a crossroads in its history, a nation in thrall to new technology while clinging desperately to belief.</p><p>PETER MANSEAU is the author of the nonfiction books <i>Vows</i>, <i>Rag and Bone</i>, and <i>One Nation, Under Gods</i>; and the novel <i>Songs for the Butcher&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, a winner of the National Jewish Book Award.

Manseau has created an exceptional story of how photography intersects with the hope that some heretofore unexplored scientific process will reveal something about the nature of man and our limitations."<b>&#x2014;Errol Morris, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> "A sensitive, insightful history."<b>&#x2014;<i>The New Yorker</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> "Mr. Manseau develops these threads so that The Apparitionists itself is like a photograph&#x2014;each successive chapter adding depth and shade and specks of mystery, until the final result magically appears, provoking as many questions as it provides answers."&#x2014;<b><i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Given that the path loops through the Civil War, the telegraph, P.T.

The tone is knowledgeable, but the touch is light; technology is deftly explained, figures who have been gone too long are always briefly reintroduced, and Manseau is happy to reassure you you're reading a history.

He was a huckster, but like all successful hucksters, he was a perfect reflection of his time. Peter Manseau's <i>The Apparitionist</i>s recreates Mumler's life with a scholar's poise and a storyteller's grace, offering an enduring portrait of the nineteenth century through one of its most unlikely figures.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Colin Dickey</b>, author of<i> Ghostland: An American History in Haunted Places</i><br><br> &#x201c;Manseau has become the foremost chronicler of the deep American desire to believe in the weird, the strange, and oddly wonderful.

Zimmer, an award-winning science writer, takes readers on a fascinating journey into the latest discoveries about evolution. In the Canadian Arctic, paleontologists unearth fossils documenting the move of our ancestors from sea to land. In the outback of Australia, a zoologist tracks some of the world&#x2019;s deadliest snakes to decipher the 100-million-year evolution of venom molecules. In Africa, geneticists are gathering DNA to probe the origin of our species. In clear, non-technical language, Zimmer explains the central concepts essential for understanding new advances in evolution, including natural selection, genetic drift, and sexual selection. He demonstrates how vital evolution is to all branches of modern biology&#x2014;from the fight against deadly antibiotic-resistant bacteria to the analysis of the human genome.</p><p>Carl Zimmer is one of the country&#39;s leading science writers. A columnist for The New York Times and a regular contributor to magazines like Scientific American and National Geographic, he is the author of thirteen books, including Evolution: The Triumph of an Idea and A Planet of Viruses.

Gregorian psalm tone; iv. English psalm tone. Optional psalm verses are provided in the Gregorian psalm tone style. Thus this collection provides an option intended to suit the abilities and needs of any choir or cantor.</p><br><p>Ordination and nuptial Masses are also included, as well as the <em>Asperges me</em> and <em>Vidi aquam</em>. The <em>Gloria Patri</em> is given in the eight Gregorian tones, solemn and simple.</p></p><p>"I highly recommend this new English Gradual to anyone who wants to sing the proper antiphons on a regular basis and is looking for very accessible, yet most beautiful chant in the vernacular. We cannot thank Fr. Samuel Weber enough for all his hard work, a true labor of love and dedication to liturgy and the Church. I am most confident that this new Gradual will become a standard work and hopefully find a home in many parishes." --<strong>Dr. Horz Buckholtz</strong>, Director of Sacred Music Cathedral Basilica of Saint Louis, St. Louis, MO<br><br>"Fr. Samuel Weber has performed an outstanding service to the liturgy of the English-speaking world. He has taken the antiphons of the new English translation of the RomanMissal and provided musical settings for them that are accessible to both parishes and choirs of various levels. In doing so, he has enabled the Catholic faithful to encounter the word of God in an English context that has been inaccessible to them for far too long. The Church has, for centuries, used these antiphons in Latin for her official worship, and now Fr. Weber has made that possible in English as well.<p></p><br><p>"Fr. Weber has made a quite remarkable contribution to the handing down of the Tradition-in the midst of the Church-in medio ecclesiae. May this collection serve the Church's liturgy, her 'source and summit' in numerous ways, some of which will be known only in eternity." --<strong>Rev. Kurt Belsole, O.S.B.</strong>, Director of Liturgical Formation Pontifical North American College, Vatican City</p></p><h2>A Princess of Mars</h2><p>Suddenly projected to Mars, John Carter found himself captive of the savage green men of Thark.

And between them and rescue lay a thousand miles of deadly enemies and unknown dangers.<br><br><i>The green warrior decided to close in and end the battle; just as he rushed me, a blinding light struck full in my eyes, so that I could not see Zad's approach and could only leap blindly to one side to avoid his mighty blade.&nbsp;<br><br>It caught me in the left shoulder; but as my vision cleared a sight met my astonished gaze that almost made me forget the fight. Standing on her chariot with Sola and Sarkoja, my beloved Dejah Thoris turned on Sarkoja with the fury of a tigress and struck something that flashed in the sunlight from her upraised hand.

Burroughs's first sale (in 1912) was <i>A Princess of Mars</i>, opening the floodgates to one of the must successful--and prolific--literary careers in history. This is a wonderful scientific romance that perhaps can be best described as early science fiction melded with an epic dose of romantic adventure. <i>A Princess of Mars</i> is the first adventure of John Carter, a Civil War veteran who unexpectedly find himself transplanted to the planet Mars. Yet this red planet is far more than a dusty, barren place; it's a fantasy world populated with giant green barbarians, beautiful maidens in distress, and weird flora and monstrous fauna the likes of which could only exist in the author's boundless imagination. Sheer escapism of the tallest order, the Martian novels are perfect entertainment for those who find Tarzan's fantastic adventures aren't, well, fantastic enough. Although this novel can stand alone, there are a total of 11 volumes in this classic series of otherworldly, swashbuckling adventure. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Great, addictive serial fun.

Recently, ancient magic has hit a high in popularity, both as an area of scholarly inquiry and as one of general, popular interest. In <em>Magic, Witchcraft, and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman Worlds</em> Daniel Ogden presents three hundred texts in new translations, along with brief but explicit commentaries. This is the first book in the field to unite extensive selections from both literary and documentary sources. Alongside descriptions of sorcerers, witches, and ghosts in the works of ancient writers, it reproduces curse tablets, spells from ancient magical recipe books, and inscriptions from magical amulets. Each translation is followed by a commentary that puts it in context within ancient culture and connects the passage to related passages in this volume. Authors include the well known (Sophocles, Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Virgil, Pliny) and the less familiar, and extend across the whole of Greco-Roman antiquity.</p><p><br>Daniel Ogden is Professor of Ancient History at the University of Exeter.<br><br>"This is a marvelous book, in every sense of the word. For one thing, it is full of marvels--marvelous stories of ghostly and magical happenings.... And for another, it is marvelously assembled, making it a reference source that everyone researching this field will be delighted to possess....

Just as the Hebrews were slaves in Egypt, we have become slaves to technology. Our technological tools allow 24-hour productivity and connectivity, give us more control, and subtlety enslave us to busyness itself. Sabbath is about restraint, about intentionally not doing everything all the time just because we can. Setting aside a day of rest helps us reconnect with our Creator and find the peace of God that passes all understanding. The Sabbath is about letting go of the controls one day a week and letting God be God. So how do we do it?<br><br>In <i>24/6,</i> Dr. Matthew Sleeth describes our symptoms, clarifies the signs, diagnoses the illness, and lays out a simple plan for living a healthier, more God-centered life in a digitally-dazed, always-on world. Sleeth shares how his own family was dramatically transformed when it adopted Sabbath practices and helps readers better understand how their own lives can be transformed &#x2013; physically, emotionally, relationally and spiritually &#x2013; by adopting the 24/6 lifestyle.</p><p><b>&#x201c;Remember the Sabbath and keep it<i> holy</i>.&#x201d;</b><br>It&#x2019;s the only commandment that begins with the word <i>remember</i>&#x2015;almost as if God <i>knew</i> we would forget.<br><br>Well, guess what?<br><br>We did.<br><br>And is it any wonder? Look around. Thanks to ever-improving technology, we now feel the pressure to be &#x201c;on&#x201d; twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Sure, things like smart phones, the Internet, Facebook, Twitter, and Skype help us stay connected with coworkers, family, and friends&#x2015;but what about God?<br><br>How can we possibly have &#x201c;ears to hear&#x201d; when we are plugged in 24/7? If we never take time to &#x201c;be still and know&#x201d; God, how can we grow into mature spiritual beings?<br><br>The solution is simple. And it is endorsed by the Great Physician himself. In fact, he invented it. It&#x2019;s called rest. And like all good things, rest is a gift from God.<br><br>Rest doesn&#x2019;t just happen. It takes intentionality, commitment, and restraint. Yet the rewards are indescribably amazing.<br><br>In <i>24/6</i>, Dr. Matthew Sleeth provides a life-giving prescription for a healthier, more God-centered life amidst a digitally crazed, always-on world and helps us better understand how our lives can be radically transformed&#x2015;physically, emotionally, relationally, and spiritually&#x2015;by adopting a 24/6 lifestyle.<b>Matthew Sleeth</b>,MD, a former emergency room physician and chief of hospital medical staff, resigned from his position to teach, preach, and write about the biblical call to be good stewards of God's creation.

From a delicate pair of earrings from a steppe tomb to a massive stupa deep in Central Asia, a hoard of Kushan coins stored in an Ethiopian monastery to a Hellenistic glass bowl from a southern Chinese tomb, and a fragment of Byzantine silk wrapping the bones of a French saint to a Bactrian ewer depicting episodes from the Trojan War, these objects show us something of the cultural diversity and interaction along these trading routes of Afro-Eurasia.<br> &nbsp;<br> Exploring the labor, tools, materials, and rituals behind these various objects, Whitfield infuses her narrative with delightful details as the objects journey through time, space, and meaning.&nbsp;<i>Silk, Slaves, and Stupas</i>&nbsp;is a lively, visual, and tangible way to understand the Silk Road and the cultural, economic, and technical changes of the late antique and medieval worlds.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p>"In the tradition of Neil MacGregor's <i>History of the World in 100 Objects</i>, but digging deeper, Susan Whitfield takes us on a tour of Silk Road culture and history via ten exemplary pieces (nine inanimate, one human). Each chapter's discussion spirals out from the object to take in history, technology, trade patterns, ancient and modern provenance, museology and other aspects, linking Silk Road past to globalizing present. Whitfield's micro-to-macro treatment of this handful of key Eurasian things is new to books on the Silk Road. Her expertise in art history, history, archaeology, museology, Dunhuangology, and other specialties is very much in evidence; few if any other scholars could do what she has done here. More than that, however, she manages to write for the student, the museum-goer, and the armchair traveler, as well as for the specialist."&#x2014;James A. Millward, author of&nbsp;<i>The Silk Road: A Very Short Introduction</i><br><br> "No one knows more about the material culture of the Silk Road than Susan Whitfield. With this book it's now clear that no one tells the story of the early world through objects better than she does.

Giving the laity access to the word of God outraged the clerical establishment in England: he was condemned, hunted, and eventually murdered. However, his masterly translation formed the basis of all English bibles--including the "King James Bible," many of whose finest passages were taken unchanged, though unacknowledged, from Tyndale's work.<br><br>This important book, published in the quincentenary year of his birth, is the first major biography of Tyndale in sixty years. It sets the story of his life in the intellectual and literary contexts of his immense achievement and explores his influence on the theology, literature, and humanism of Renaissance and Reformation Europe. <br><br>David Daniell, editor of <i>Tyndale's New Testament</i> and <i>Tyndale's Old Testament</i>, eloquently describes the dramatic turns in Tyndale's life. Born in England and educated at Oxford, Tyndale was ordained as a priest. When he decided to translate the Bible into English, he realized that it was impossible to do that work in England and moved to Germany, living in exile there and in the Low Countries while he translated and printed first the New Testament and then half of the Old Testament. These were widely circulated&#x2015;and denounced&#x2015;in England. Yet Tyndale continued to write from abroad, publishing polemics in defense of the principles of the English reformation. He was seized in Antwerp, imprisoned in Vilvoorde Castle near Brussels, and burnt at the stake for heresy in 1536.<br><br>Daniell discusses Tyndale's achievement as biblical translator and expositor, analyzes his writing, examines his stylistic influence on writers from Shakespeare to those of the twentieth century, and explores the reasons why he has not been more highly regarded. His book brings to life one of the great geniuses of the age.</p><p>Several popular histories of the King James Bible are available to interested readers, including works that concentrate on the book's political influence <i>Wide as the Waters</i>) and its theological import (<i>In the Beginning</i>). Perhaps the most readable survey of the <i>language</i> of the King James Version, however, comes in the form of a biography of its primary translator. <i>William Tyndale: A Biography</i> by David Daniell (a University of London scholar and chairman of the William Tyndale Society) reveals all that is known of Tyndale's life, but its primary interest is in Tyndale's rhetorical style. Daniell asserts, convincingly, that Tyndale "made a language for England," in the same way that Martin Luther is acknowledged having united Germany's dialects in his German translation of the New Testament. The biography recites many widely known facts (Tyndale wrote nine-tenths of the King James Version's New Testament (the gospel Christmas stories--"there were shepherds abiding in the fields"--are Tyndale's), and half of its Old Testament ("Let there be light" is another of Tyndale's phrases). More importantly, Daniell's biography describes the development of Tyndale's skills as a linguist (he commanded eight languages, including Hebrew, at a time when Hebrew was virtually unknown in England) and parses Tyndale's adaptation of Greek, Hebrew, and Latin syntax into English. In the first sentence of his introduction to this book, Daniell states that "William Tyndale gave us our English Bible." The verb in that sentence is the key to this biography: it is a work of gratitude. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>David Daniell</b> is Professor of English in the University of London.

Case-making, the essence of convincing, is then carried over into learning how to persuade, which, requires explicit attention to appeals to character, emotion, and style. Finally, the previous three aims all play roles in negotiation, which amounts to finding and defending positions capable of appealing to all sides in a dispute or controversy.</p><p></p><h2>Grief Counseling and Grief Therapy: A Handbook for the Mental Health Practitioner, Third Edition</h2><p><p><i>Praise for earlier editions:</i><br><br>Worden ... has again provided mental health professionals with a superb guide describing specific principles and procedures that may be helpful in working with bereaved clients undergoing normal or abnormal grief reactions .... an extremely practical book and an invaluable resource.<br>--<i>Contemporary Psychology</i></p> <br> <p>This book is the 'Bible' for those involved in the field of bereavement work...It is a straightforward, tightly focused, practical, soundly reasoned, compact working text." <br> --William M.

In a massive series of thirteen books, Ptolemy shows how every detail of the motions of the sun, moon, planets, and stars can be expressed using geometrical models that can be used to compute celestial positions with remarkable accuracy<br>The present selection covers all the essential features of Ptolemy&#x2019;s treatment of the heavens, omitting only more difficult and abstruse matters such as the moon&#x2019;s motion and the calculation of eclipses. In the interest of conciseness, development of planetary theories is restricted to two planets, one inferior (Venus) and one superior (Mars). <br>Ptolemy&#x2019;s text is accompanied by extensive notes and introductions that are aimed at making the book accessible to students encountering Ptolemy for the first time. This edition is designed to provide everything needed for a one-semester course, or it can be a component of a more general course on planetary theory or history of astronomy.</p><p></p><h2>Essential Calculations for Veterinary Nurses and Technicians</h2><p>This new edition continues to explain common mathematical principles in veterinary terms. With the introduction of the Evolve platform, both student and qualified nurses or technicians benefit from an interactive site where they can test their knowledge with interactive questions and quizzes; while instructors can create their own quizzes and tasks to use as aids in their teaching. Drawing upon his extensive experience, Terry Lake also provides a method of conversion that simplifies equations and removes the necessity of memorizing formulae. Terry Lake is also joined in this second edition by Nicola Green, an experienced instructor in dosage calculations who has devised the Evolve component. The text uses a commonsense approach to clinical situations faced by every student and qualified practitioner, highlighting common errors and providing tips for avoiding potential pitfalls. This extremely useful text takes the student from the secure ground of decimals and percentages, through to the uncharted terrain of statistics and dimensional analysis &#x2013; all in an easily accessible and user-friendly style.<ul><li>A comprehensive textbook covering all aspects of calculations as applied to veterinary nursing - from basic arithmetic to dilutions and statistics</li><li> Well illustrated for maximum clarity and understanding</li><li>Guidance tips for tricky areas ensure that repetition of common errors is avoided</li><li>Self-test sections plus clinical hints and tips ensure quick retention of core facts</li><li>An essential text at all levels of training - from Animal Care to Advanced Diploma</li></ul></p><p>Nicola Green is Lecturer in Veterinary Nursing and Internal Verifier, Northumbria School of Veterinary Nursing, Newcastle College, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK."This is a head-banging subject, which many try to steer clear of, made easy and fun - I wish there had been a book published of this kind when I was undergoing my veterinary nursing training.

As often as possible, he accompanies his pilot friend, Sam Taylor, on animal rescue flights.Self-taught artist Engelbreit, who lives in a St. Louis suburb, runs her own enormously successful greeting-card company; her illustrated books, journals and diaries (published by Andrews &amp; McMeel) have a loyal following; and she also makes calendars, mugs and other products that sell in her own retail stores and elsewhere. This engaging scrapbook combines a biographical sketch with a perceptive discussion of her art. Her vibrantly colorful, richly detailed pictures contain familiar elements: spunky girls, straw hats, cottage roses, old-fashioned toys, well-dressed snakes, cats with angel-wings and decorative borders. Her fantasy graphics meld gypsies, dragons, spaceships, unicorns and UFOs. She also offers witty takes on childhood and hopeful images of multiethnic, multiracial cooperation. Whimsical, nostalgic and often veering to the cute or sentimental, her art nevertheless maintains a heartfelt connection to the real world in its celebration of love, faith, hope, decency and the vicissitudes of everyday life. 75,000 first printing; author tour. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mosby&#39;s 2020 Nursing Drug Reference (Skidmore Nursing Drug Reference)</h2><p><p>Put the most trusted name in nursing in your hands. <b>Mosby's 2020 Nursing Drug Reference</b> is a full-color portable nursing drug handbook that makes it easy to find the most vital information on the drugs that nurses administer most frequently.

Thomas Barfield introduces readers to the bewildering diversity of tribal and ethnic groups in Afghanistan, explaining what unites them as Afghans despite the regional, cultural, and political differences that divide them. He shows how governing these peoples was relatively easy when power was concentrated in a small dynastic elite, but how this delicate political order broke down in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when Afghanistan's rulers mobilized rural militias to expel first the British and later the Soviets. Armed insurgency proved remarkably successful against the foreign occupiers, but it also undermined the Afghan government's authority and rendered the country ever more difficult to govern as time passed. Barfield vividly describes how Afghanistan's armed factions plunged the country into a civil war, giving rise to clerical rule by the Taliban and Afghanistan's isolation from the world. He examines why the American invasion in the wake of September 11 toppled the Taliban so quickly, and how this easy victory lulled the United States into falsely believing that a viable state could be built just as easily.</p><br><br><p> <i>Afghanistan</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how a land conquered and ruled by foreign dynasties for more than a thousand years became the "graveyard of empires" for the British and Soviets, and what the United States must do to avoid a similar fate.</p></p><p><p>"This fascinating survey of Afghanistan is an excellent book for those wanting to go beyond headlines. Written by an expert, with the stylistic flair to be savored by the nonexpert, <i>Afghanistan</i> also has judgments worthy of scholarly reflection. Barfield has captured political, social, and cultural insights of extraordinary importance to the policy arguments of today and tomorrow. Deploying diplomats, soldiers, and aid workers in particular should pay attention."<b>--Ronald E. Neumann, U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, 2005-2007</b></p><p>"Barfield's book will become the single best source on Afghan history and politics virtually overnight. His deep knowledge of Afghanistan enables him to range widely and knit together a very coherent narrative with a conceptual clarity that is pretty rare. A great deal of learning is evident here, but Barfield wears it lightly."<b>--James C. Scott, author of <i>Seeing Like a State</i></b></p><p>"Barfield's book is an excellent general introduction to the country and will be a source of wider debate within and beyond the scholarly community.

Social media has made charts, infographics, and diagrams ubiquitous&#x2015;and easier to share than ever. We associate charts with science and reason; the flashy visuals are both appealing and persuasive. Pie charts, maps, bar and line graphs, and scatter plots (to name a few) can better inform us, revealing patterns and trends hidden behind the numbers we encounter in our lives. In short, good charts make us smarter&#x2015;if we know how to read them.</p><p>However, they can also lead us astray. Charts lie in a variety of ways&#x2015;displaying incomplete or inaccurate data, suggesting misleading patterns, and concealing uncertainty&#x2015;or are frequently misunderstood, such as the confusing cone of uncertainty maps shown on TV every hurricane season. To make matters worse, many of us are ill-equipped to interpret the visuals that politicians, journalists, advertisers, and even our employers present each day, enabling bad actors to easily manipulate them to promote their own agendas.</p><p>In <em>How Charts Lie</em>, data visualization expert Alberto Cairo teaches us to not only spot the lies in deceptive visuals, but also to take advantage of good ones to understand complex stories. Public conversations are increasingly propelled by numbers, and to make sense of them we must be able to decode and use visual information. By examining contemporary examples ranging from election-result infographics to global GDP maps and box-office record charts, <em>How Charts Lie</em> demystifies an essential new literacy, one that will make us better equipped to navigate our data-driven world.</p> 175 illustrations</p><p><strong>Alberto Cairo</strong> is a journalist and designer, and the Knight Chair in Visual Journalism at the School of Communication of the University of Miami.

Acock's <strong>A Gentle Introduction to Stata, Fifth Edition</strong>,<br>is aimed at new Stata users who want to become proficient in Stata.<br>After reading this introductory text, new users will be able not only<br>to use Stata well but also to learn new aspects of Stata.<br><br>Acock assumes that the user is not familiar with any statistical<br>software. This assumption of a blank slate is central to the structure<br>and contents of the book. Acock starts with the basics; for example,<br>the portion of the book that deals with data management begins with a<br>careful and detailed example of turning survey data on paper into a<br>Stata-ready dataset on the computer. When explaining how to go about<br>basic exploratory statistical procedures, Acock includes notes that<br>will help the reader develop good work habits. This mixture of<br>explaining good Stata habits and good statistical habits continues<br>throughout the book.<br><br>Acock is quite careful to teach the reader all aspects of using Stata.<br>He covers data management, good work habits (including the use of<br>basic do-files), basic exploratory statistics (including graphical<br>displays), and analyses using the standard array of basic statistical<br>tools (correlation, linear and logistic regression, and parametric and<br>nonparametric tests of location and dispersion). He also successfully<br>introduces some more advanced topics such as multiple imputation and<br>structural equation modeling in a very approachable manner. Acock<br>teaches Stata commands by using the menus and dialog boxes while still<br>stressing the value of do-files. In this way, he ensures that all<br>types of users can build good work habits. Each chapter has exercises<br>that the motivated reader can use to reinforce the material.<br><br>The tone of the book is friendly and conversational without ever being<br>glib or condescending. Important asides and notes about terminology<br>are set off in boxes, which makes the text easy to read without any<br>convoluted twists or forward-referencing. Rather than splitting topics<br>by their Stata implementation, Acock arranges the topics as they would<br>appear in a basic statistics textbook; graphics and postestimation are<br>woven into the material in a natural fashion. Real datasets, such as<br>the <em>General Social Surveys</em> from 2002 and 2006, are used<br>throughout the book.<br><br>The focus of the book is especially helpful for those in the<br>behavioral and social sciences because the presentation of basic<br>statistical modeling is supplemented with discussions of effect sizes<br>and standardized coefficients. Various selection criteria, such as<br>semipartial correlations, are discussed for model selection. Acock<br>also covers a variety of commands available for evaluating reliability<br>and validity of measurements.<br><br>The fifth edition of the book includes two new chapters that cover<br>multilevel modeling and item response theory (IRT) models. The<br>multilevel modeling chapter demonstrates how to fit linear multilevel<br>models using the <strong>mixed</strong> command. Acock discusses models with<br>both random intercepts and random coefficients, and he provides a<br>variety of examples that apply these models to longitudinal data. The<br>IRT chapter introduces the use of IRT models for evaluating a set of<br>items designed to measure a specific trait such as an attitude, value,<br>or a belief. Acock shows how to use the <b>irt</b> suite of commands,<br>which are new in Stata 14, to fit IRT models and to graph the results.<br>In addition, he presents a measure of reliability that can be computed<br>when using IRT.<br></p></p><p>Alan Acock (Ph.D., Washington State University) is Professor and former Chair of Human Development and Family Sciences at Oregon State University.

Zero is lonely in Digitaria. He can&#39;t play Addemup with the other numbers because he has nothing to add. All the other numbers seem to belong and they all have a place, but when zero discovers multiplication he thinks he might have a place there. He sets out to find King Multiplus who also is curious about what will happen when Zero gets thrown in the mix. With math and wordplay A Place for Zero is the perfect introduction to multiplication and number placement. A playful way to make math less intimidating and more fun to explore.</p><p>A native New Yorker, Angeline Sparagna LoPresti taught math to second through eighth graders for twenty-five years. Prior to her teaching career, she was a medical research assistant at the Department of Bacteriology at Cornell University Medical School. Now retired, Mrs. LoPresti occupies her leisure time with indoor gardening, reading, cooking, and photography.Grade 2-3-This story about sad Zero, who "felt he had no place among the other digits," falls between the cracks in terms of finding an audience. In his search for meaning, he meets Count Infinity, King Multiplus, and Queen Addeleine. The lively, colorful cartoons of legged numbers would appeal to preschoolers or kindergartners, but the vocabulary, concepts, and puns ("Absolute nine-sense. It's two much!") are beyond their understanding. There are also a few confusing lessons, such as Zero's explanation that "When I stand in this place, next to my friend 1, as a zero I can represent zero 1s. But he now represents 9 + 1." Given the art, it's unfortunate that the author didn't stick with beginner-level math instead of proceeding to tackle multiplication and place values. As it stands, most readers will either be confused or feel patronized. Stick with Alexandra Wright's Alice in Pastaland (1997) or Cindy Neuschwander's "Sir Cumference" series (both Charlesbridge) for your math-story needs.<br><i>Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Delmar&#39;s Administrative Medical Assisting (with Premium Website, 2 terms (12 months) Printed Access Card and Medical Office Simulation Software 2.0 CD-ROM)</h2><p>In today&#39;s dynamic health care environment, medical assistants are playing an increasingly important role.

He argues that our personal relationships, moral intuitions, and aesthetic judgments hint at a transcendent dimension that cannot be understood through the lens of science alone. To be fully alive&#x2015;and to understand what we are&#x2015;is to acknowledge the reality of sacred things. Rather than an argument for the existence of God, or a defense of the truth of religion, the book is an extended reflection on why a sense of the sacred is essential to human life&#x2015;and what the final loss of the sacred would mean. In short, the book addresses the most important question of modernity: what is left of our aspirations after science has delivered its verdict about what we are?</p><p>Drawing on art, architecture, music, and literature, Scruton suggests that the highest forms of human experience and expression tell the story of our religious need, and of our quest for the being who might answer it, and that this search for the sacred endows the world with a soul. Evolution cannot explain our conception of the sacred; neuroscience is irrelevant to our interpersonal relationships, which provide a model for our posture toward God; and scientific understanding has nothing to say about the experience of beauty, which provides a God&#x2019;s-eye perspective on reality.</p><p>Ultimately, a world without the sacred would be a completely different world&#x2015;one in which we humans are not truly at home.

Instead, University of Chicago professor John J. Mearsheimer posits an almost Darwinian state of affairs: "The great powers seek to maximize their share of world power" because "having dominant power is the best means to ensure one's own survival." Mearsheimer comes from the realist school of statecraft--he calls his own brand of thinking "offensive realism"--and he warns repeatedly against putting too much faith in the goodwill of other countries. "The sad fact is that international politics has always been a ruthless and dangerous business," he writes. Much of the book is an attempt to show how the diplomatic and military history of the last two centuries supports his ideas. Toward the end of <i>The Tragedy of Great Power Politics</i>, he applies his theories to the current scene: "I believe that the existing power structures in Europe in Northeast Asia are not sustainable through 2020." Mearsheimer is especially critical of America's policy of engagement with China; he thinks that trying to make China wealthy and democratic will only make it a stronger rival. This is a controversial idea, but it is ably argued and difficult to ignore. <i>--John Miller</i>John J. Mearsheimer is the R.

But revenge is not simple. As he stalks his wife's betrayers--a chase that takes him from the wild moors of Scotland to the bustling streets of New York City and the darkest bayous of Louisiana--he is also forced to dig further into Helen's past. And he is stunned to learn that Helen may have been a collaborator in her own murder.<br><br>Peeling back the layers of deception, Pendergast realizes that the conspiracy is deeper, goes back generations, and is more monstrous than he could have ever imagined--and everything he's believed, everything he's trusted, everything he's understood . . . may be a horrific lie.</p><p>The thrillers of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child "stand head and shoulders above their rivals" (<em>Publishers Weekly</em>).

They want to change her and never let her go. </p> <p>Coraline will have to fight with all her wit and courage if she is to save herself and return to her ordinary life.</p></p><p>Coraline lives with her preoccupied parents in part of a huge old house--a house so huge that other people live in it, too... round, old former actresses Miss Spink and Miss Forcible and their aging Highland terriers ("We trod the boards, luvvy") and the mustachioed old man under the roof ("'The reason you cannot see the mouse circus,' said the man upstairs, 'is that the mice are not yet ready and rehearsed.'") Coraline contents herself for weeks with exploring the vast garden and grounds. But with a little rain she becomes bored--so bored that she begins to count everything blue (153), the windows (21), and the doors (14). And it is the 14th door that--sometimes blocked with a wall of bricks--opens up for Coraline into an entirely alternate universe. Now, if you're thinking fondly of <i>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</i> or <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, you're on the wrong track. Neil Gaiman's <i>Coraline</i> is far darker, far stranger, playing on our deepest fears. And, like Roald Dahl's work, it is delicious. <p> What's on the other side of the door? A distorted-mirror world, containing presumably everything Coraline has ever dreamed of... people who pronounce her name correctly (not "Caroline"), delicious meals (not like her father's overblown "recipes"), an unusually pink and green bedroom (not like her dull one), and plenty of horrible (very un-boring) marvels, like a man made out of live rats.

When learning shapes, Montessori students first develop an understanding of the spatial object in comparison to other shapes and a relevant application for each shape&#x2014;<i>before </i>learning the names. Inspired by this process, <i>Montessori: Shape Work </i>offers readers die-cut shapes to trace with their fingers, grouped by family for comparison, and illustrated with a familiar object for relevancy. Featured shapes include three triangles (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled); three rounds (circle, oval, ellipse); three parallelograms (square, rectangle, rhombus); and three polygons (pentagon, hexagon, octagon). With a letter to parents included, this third Montessori board book joins <i>Montessori: Letter Work </i>and <i>Montessori: Number Work </i>in a growing library of original concept books.<p></p></p><p><b>Bobby George </b>and <b>June George </b>live in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, where they founded Baan Dek, the first Montessori school in the state, and run Montessorium, an app company.<b><p></p></b></p><h2>Destroyer of the gods: Early Christian Distinctiveness in the Roman World</h2><p><p>"Silly," "stupid," "irrational," "simple." "Wicked," "hateful," "obstinate," "anti-social." "Extravagant," "perverse." The Roman world rendered harsh judgments upon early Christianity&#x2015;including branding Christianity "new." Novelty was no Roman religious virtue.</p><p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;as Larry W. Hurtado shows in <i>Destroyer of the gods</i>, Christianity thrived despite its new and distinctive features and opposition to them. Unlike nearly all other religious groups, Christianity utterly rejected the traditional gods of the Roman world. Christianity also offered a new and different kind of religious identity, one not based on ethnicity. Christianity was distinctively a "bookish" religion, with the production, copying, distribution, and reading of texts as central to its faith, even preferring a distinctive book-form, the codex. Christianity insisted that its adherents behave differently: unlike the simple ritual observances characteristic of the pagan religious environment, embracing Christian faith meant a behavioral transformation, with particular and novel ethical demands for men. Unquestionably, to the Roman world, Christianity was both new and different, and, to a good many, it threatened social and religious conventions of the day.</p><p>In the rejection of the gods and in the centrality of texts, early Christianity obviously reflected commitments inherited from its Jewish origins. But these particular features were no longer identified with Jewish ethnicity and early Christianity quickly became aggressively trans-ethnic&#x2015;a novel kind of religious movement. Its ethical teaching, too, bore some resemblance to the philosophers of the day, yet in contrast with these great teachers and their small circles of dedicated students, early Christianity laid its hard demands upon all adherents from the moment of conversion, producing a novel social project. </p><p>Christianity&#x2019;s novelty was no badge of honor. Called atheists and suspected of&nbsp;political subversion, Christians&nbsp;earned Roman disdain and suspicion in equal amounts. Yet, as <i>Destroyer of the gods</i> demonstrates, in&nbsp;an irony of history the very features of early Christianity that rendered it distinctive and objectionable in Roman eyes have now become so commonplace in Western culture as to go unnoticed. Christianity helped destroy one world and create another.</p></p><p><p>Larry W. Hurtado is Emeritus Professor of New Testament Language, Literature &amp; Theology in the School of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Born in Kansas City (Missouri), he now lives in Edinburgh.</p><p>Comprehensive and quietly authoritative, Larry Hurtado&#x2019;s <i>Destroyer of the gods</i> offers its readers a three-centuries&#x2019; tour of the Christianizing Mediterranean. The sweep of his panorama never sacrifices the liveliness of telling detail. For those who ask, &#x2018;What was distinctive about this new religious movement?&#x2019; Hurtado offers thoughtful answers. Make room for this book, whether on bedside table or in classroom syllabus&#x2015;or both.</p> (Paula Fredriksen, Distinguished Visiting Professor of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University)<br><br><p>In this lucid and wide-ranging book, Larry Hurtado convincingly shows how novel and distinctive early Christianity was in the religious world of the first century. He argues that early Christianity was in many respects a different kind of religion, and was revolutionary in the way that &#x2018;religion&#x2019; has been understood ever since. Along the way, Hurtado sheds much light on the New Testament and on second century Christianity. He hopes to enhance &#x2018;our appreciation of the remarkable religious movement&#x2019; that was early Christianity, and he admirably achieves exactly that.</p> (Paul Trebilco, Professor of New Testament, University of Otago)<br><br><p>Hurtado sets out to awaken us from our &#x2018;cultural amnesia,&#x2019; to remind us that the origin of Christianity and its remarkable success has more to do with its ability to distinguish itself from other religions in antiquity than to be one with them. Hurtado challenges readers to reconsider what have become common assumptions of religion today&#x2015;that there is a single God and that religious affiliation is a voluntary choice. Without the distinctive rise of Christianity, none of these would be so.</p> (April D. DeConick, Chair of the Department of Religion, Rice University)<br><br><p>In this very accessible and readable book, Larry Hurtado shows how really distinct early Christianity was in comparison to its surrounding cultures of Greco-Roman paganism and Judaism. This was not only true for aspects of early Christian life that are somewhat familiar to many of us, such as its stricter sexual code, but even here Hurtado shows that the early Christians took their code &#x2018;to the streets&#x2019; and opposed the double standard of their day. D <i>estroyer of the gods </i>is an exciting read across a wide range of interests in early Christianity coupled with many comparisons to religious life today.</p> (Jan N. Bremmer, Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies, University of Groningen)<br><br><p>Clear and enlightening, Hurtado&#x2019;s coverage of the first centuries of Christianity explains why it was different, more philosophy than religion, and how its emergence as the supreme religion in the Roman world is less paradoxical than usually argued.&nbsp;This account is the nearest one can get to meeting an early Christian and quizzing them.</p> (Robin Cormack, Emeritus Professor, Courtauld Institute of Art)<br><br><p>This is a fascinating survey of the features that made Christianity distinctive in antiquity and so&#x2015;ultimately&#x2015;successful. Hurtado discusses the Christian concept of an exclusive veneration of God, the trans-ethnic and trans-local religious identity, the central role of books and learning and distinctive and challenging forms of behavior within their ancient context. The glimpses into the first three centuries may even inspire contemporary Christians to find their identity and negotiate between social assimilation and difference.</p> (J�rg Frey, Chair of New Testament Studies, University of Z�rich)</p><h2>Devotedly: The Personal Letters and Love Story of Jim and Elisabeth Elliot</h2><p><p><b>Their paths to God&#x2019;s purpose led them together.</b><br><br><b>Many know the heroic story</b>&nbsp;of Jim Elliot&#x2019;s violent death in 1956, killed along with four other missionaries by a primitive Ecuadorian tribe they were seeking to reach.

She lives in Portland, Oregon.Set in the high mountain country of Oregon during the 1890s, this first novel is a quiet, unsparing portrait of pioneer life, recounted simply and without romanticism. Drawing on pioneer diaries, journals and hand-me-down stories of her own ancestors, Gloss displays a deep awareness not only of the brutal hardships of frontier life, but also of the moral codes and emotional attachments of the people who settled there. Drawn by the freedom the West offers, Lydia Sanderson leaves a disappointing marriage in Pennsylvania and comes to Jump-Off Creek to homestead a place of her own. Tim Whiteaker, "gone cowboying" since the age of 13, and his partner, the half-Indian Blue Odell, raise cattle nearby. Three wolfers, squatting on abandoned property near Jump-Off Creek and walking the thin edge of the law in order to earn a marginal living, provide much of the tension within the novel. The author's intimate understanding of the harsh physical conditions and of the rituals and practices of frontier life (there are long descriptions of how to brand cattle and how to mend a roof) sometimes overshadows a deeper delineation of character. However, most of the scenes are handled with a restraint that communicates the characters' endemic loneliness, and the dialogue, though spare, is rich enough to convey their emotional conflicts. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Eaters of the Dead: The Manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, Relating His Experiences with the Northmen in A. D. 922 (A Bantam Book)</h2><p>The manuscript of Ibn Fadlan, relating his experiences with the Northmen in A.D. 922. Illustrated Edition.</p><p>Michael Crichton takes the listener on a one-thousand-year-old journey in his adventure novel <i>Eaters Of The Dead</i>. This remarkable true story originated from actual journal entries of an Arab man who traveled with a group of Vikings throughout northern Europe. In 922 A.D, Ibn Fadlan, a devout Muslim, left his home in Baghdad on a mission to the King of Saqaliba. During his journey, he meets various groups of "barbarians" who have poor hygiene and gorge themselves on food, alcohol and sex. For Fadlan, his new traveling companions are a far stretch from society in the sophisticated "City of Peace." The conservative and slightly critical man describes the Vikings as "tall as palm trees with florid and ruddy complexions." Fadlan is astonished by their lustful aggression and their apathy towards death. He witnesses everything from group orgies to violent funeral ceremonies. Despite the language and cultural barriers, Ibn Fadlan is welcomed into the clan. The leader of the group, Buliwyf (who can communicate in Latin) takes Fadlan under his wing. <p> Without warning, the chieftain is ordered to haul his warriors back to Scandinavia to save his people from the "monsters of the mist." Ibn Fadlan follows the clan and must rise to the occasion in the battle of his life. The unabridged story is read by actor Victor Garber (<i>Titanic</i>; <i>The First Wives Club</i>), who brings life and a personality to the plot--convincingly portraying each character with appropriate accents. Crichton also sets the stage in the beginning and chimes in every so often to clarify historical places and events. If you love historical action thrillers, but are short on time, this audio book packs an epic journey into a three hour adventure. <i>--Gina Kaysen</i> (<i>Running time: 3 Hours; 2 cassettes</i>)</p><p>From the bestselling author of <em>Jurassic Park</em>, an epic tale of unspeakable horror</p><p>The year is A.D. 922.&nbsp; A refined Arab courtier, representative of the powerful Caliph of Baghdad, encounters a party of Viking warriors who are journeying to the barbaric North.

Yet each stands on its own.<br><br>"The Finder," a novella set a few hundred years before A Wizard of Earthsea, presents a dark and troubled Archipelago and shows how some of its customs and institutions came to be. "The Bones of the Earth" features the wizards who taught the wizard who first taught Ged and demonstrates how humility, if great enough, can contend with an earthquake. "Darkrose and Diamond" is a delightful story of young courtship showing that wizards sometimes pursue alternative careers. "On the High Marsh" tells of the love of power-and of the power of love. "Dragonfly" shows how a determined woman can break the glass ceiling of male magedom. <br><br>Concluding with an account of Earthsea's history, people, languages, literature, and magic, this collection also features two new maps of Earthsea.<br> <br></p><p>Winner of five Nebula and five Hugo Awards, the National Book Award, the Newbery, and many other awards, Ursula K. Le Guin is one of the finest authors ever to write science fiction and fantasy. Her greatest creation may be the powerful, beautifully written, and deeply imagined Earthsea Cycle, which inhabits the rarified air at the pinnacle of modern fantasy with J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy and Jane Yolen's Chronicles of Great Alta. The books of the Earthsea Cycle are <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i> (1968), <i>The Tombs of Atuan</i> (1971), <i>The Farthest Shore</i> (1972), the Nebula-winning <i>Tehanu</i> (1990), and now, <i>Tales of Earthsea</i> (2001).<p> If you have never read an Earthsea book, this collection isn't the place to start, as the author points out in her thoughtful foreword; begin with <i>A Wizard of Earthsea</i>. If you insist on starting with <i>Tales of Earthsea</i>, read the foreword and the appended "Description of Earthsea" before proceeding to the five stories (three of which are original to this book).</p><p> The opening story, "The Finder," occupies a third of the volume and has the strength and insight of a novel. This novella describes the youth of Otter, a powerful but half-trained sorcerer, and reveals how Otter came to an isle that cannot be found, and played a role in the founding of the great Roke School. "Darkrose and Diamond" tells of two lovers who would turn their backs on magic. In "The Bones of the Earth," an aging wizard and his distant pupil must somehow join forces to oppose an earthquake. Ged, the Archmage of Earthsea, appears in "On the High Marsh" to find the mad and dangerous mage he had driven from Roke Island. And in "Dragonfly," the closing story, a mysterious woman comes to the Roke School to challenge the rule that only men may be mages. "Dragonfly" takes place a few years after <i>Tehanu</i> and is the bridge between that novel and the next novel, <i>The Other Wind</i> (fall 2001). <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>Ursula K.

To answer this question, Robert Temple traces the traditions of four African tribes back 5,000 years to the ancient Mediterranean cultures of Sumer and Egypt. He shows that these cultures possessed great knowledge, much of which they claimed was given them by visitors from Sirius. There are tribal cultures in present-day Africa (notably the Dogon of Mali) whose most sacred traditions are based on this theory; their knowledge of the Sirius system is astounding in its accuracy and detail, including information only recently known to modern science. <p> Many authors have speculated on the subject of extraterrestrial contact, but never before has such a detailed theory been formulated. <b>The Sirius Mystery</b> provides facts gathered during eight years of research.</p></p><p>A fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, Temple earned a degree in Oriental studies and Sanskrit at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

Stepfathers, by contrast, seemed negligible, if not completely innocuous.<br><br>&#x201c;Squire Allworthy, do you think?&#x201d; he said to his brother. &#x201c;Or Claudius?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal stood restlessly twirling the club&#x2019;s terrestrial globe, looking elegant, urbane, and thoroughly indigestible. He left off performing this activity, and gave Grey a look of incomprehension.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stepfathers,&#x201d; Grey explained. &#x201c;There seem remarkably few of them among the pages of novels, by contrast to the maternal variety. I merely wondered where Mother&#x2019;s new acquisition might fall, along the spectrum of character.&#x201d;<br><br>Hal&#x2019;s nostrils flared. His own reading tended to be confined to Tacitus and the more detailed Greek and Roman <br><br>histories of military endeavor. The practice of reading novels he regarded as a form of moral weakness; forgivable, and in fact, quite understandable in their mother, who was, after all, a woman. That his younger brother should share in this vice was somewhat less acceptable.<br><br>However, he merely said, &#x201c;Claudius? From Hamlet? Surely not, John, unless you happen to know something about Mother that I do not.&#x201d;<br><br>Grey was reasonably sure that he knew a number of things about their mother that Hal did not, but this was neither the time nor place to mention them.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you think of any other examples? Notable stepfathers of history, perhaps?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal pursed his lips, frowning a bit in thought. Absently, he touched the watch pocket at his waist.<br><br>Grey touched his own watch pocket, where the gold and crystal of his chiming timepiece&#x2014;the twin of Hal&#x2019;s&#x2014;made a reassuring weight.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not late yet.&#x201d;<br><br>Hal gave him a sideways look, not a smile&#x2014;Hal was not in a mood that would permit such an expression&#x2014;but tinged with humor, nonetheless.<br><br>&#x201c;He is at least a soldier.&#x201d;<br><br>In Grey&#x2019;s experience, membership in the brotherhood of the blade did not necessarily impute punctuality&#x2014;their friend Harry Quarry was a colonel and habitually late&#x2014;but he nodded equably. Hal was sufficiently on edge already. Grey didn&#x2019;t want to start a foolish argument that might color the imminent meeting with their mother&#x2019;s intended third husband.<br><br>&#x201c;It could be worse, I suppose,&#x201d; Hal said, returning to his moody examination of the globe. &#x201c;At least he&#x2019;s not a bloody merchant. Or a tradesman.&#x201d; His voice dripped loathing at the thought.<br><br>In fact, General Sir George Stanley was a knight, granted that distinction by reason of service of arms, rather than birth. His family had dealt in trade, though in the reasonably respectable venues of banking and shipping. Benedicta Grey, however, was a duchess. Or had been.<br><br>So far reasonably calm in the face of his mother&#x2019;s impending nuptials, Grey felt a sudden drop of the stomach, a visceral reaction to the realization that his mother would no longer be a Grey, but would become Lady Stanley&#x2014;someone quite foreign. This was, of course, ridiculous. At the same time, he found himself suddenly in greater sympathy with Hal.<br><br>The watch in his pocket began to chime noon. Hal&#x2019;s timepiece sounded no more than half a second later, and the brothers smiled at each other, hands on their pockets, suddenly united.<br><br>The watches were identical, gifts from their father upon the occasion of each son&#x2019;s twelfth birthday. The duke had died the day after Grey&#x2019;s twelfth birthday, endowing this small recognition of manhood with a particular poignancy. Grey drew breath to say something, but the sound of voices came from the corridor.<br><br>&#x201c;There he is.&#x201d; Hal lifted his head, evidently undecided whether to go out to meet Sir George or remain in the library to receive him.<br><br>&#x201c;Saint Joseph,&#x201d; Grey said suddenly. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s another notable stepfather.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quite,&#x201d; said his brother, with a sidelong glance. &#x201c;And which of us are you suggesting . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>A shadow fell across the Turkey carpet, cast by the form of a bowing servant who stood in the doorway.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir George Stanley, my lord. And party.&#x201d;<br>General Sir George Stanley was a surprise. While Grey had consciously expected neither Claudius nor Saint Joseph, the reality was a trifle . . . rounder than anticipated.<br><br>His mother&#x2019;s first husband had been tall and dashing, by report, while her second, his own father, had been possessed of the same slight stature, fairness, and tidy muscularity which he had bequeathed to both his sons. Sir George rather restored one&#x2019;s faith in the law of averages, Grey thought, amused.<br><br>A bit taller than himself or Hal, and quite stout, the general had a face that was round, cheerful, and rosily guileless beneath a rather shabby wig. His features were nondescript in the extreme, bar a pair of wide brown eyes that gave him an air of pleasant expectation, as though he could think of nothing so delightful as a meeting with the person he addressed.<br><br>He bowed in greeting, but then shook hands firmly with both Greys, leaving Lord John with an impression of warmth and sincerity.<br><br>&#x201c;It is kind of you to invite me to luncheon,&#x201d; he said, smiling from one brother to the other. &#x201c;I cannot say how greatly I appreciate your welcome. I feel most awkward, then, to begin at once with an apology&#x2014;but I am afraid I have imposed upon you by bringing my stepson. He arrived unexpectedly this morning from the country, just as I was setting out. Seeing that you will in some sense be brothers . . . I, er, thought perhaps you would pardon my liberty in bringing him along to be introduced.&#x201d; He laughed, a little awkwardly, and blushed; an odd mannerism in a man of his age and rank, but rather endearing, Grey thought, smiling back despite himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Hal said, managing to sound cordial.<br><br>&#x201c;Most certainly,&#x201d; Grey echoed. He was standing closest to Sir George, and now turned to the general&#x2019;s companion, hand extended in greeting, and found himself face to face with a tall, slender, dark-eyed young man.<br><br>&#x201c;My Lord Melton, Lord John,&#x201d; the general was saying, a hand on the young man&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;May I present Mr. Percival Wainwright?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal was a trifle put out; Grey could feel the vibrations of annoyance from his direction&#x2014;Hal hated surprises, particularly those of a social nature&#x2014;but he himself had little attention to spare for his brother&#x2019;s quirks at the moment.<br><br>&#x201c;Your servant, sir,&#x201d; he said, taking Mr. Wainwright&#x2019;s hand, with an odd sense of previous meeting.<br><br>The other felt it, too; Grey could see the faint expression of puzzlement on the young man&#x2019;s face, a faint inturning of fine dark brows, as though wondering where . . .<br><br>Realization struck them simultaneously. His hand tightened involuntarily on the other&#x2019;s, just as Wainwright&#x2019;s grip clutched his.<br><br>&#x201c;Yours, sir,&#x201d; murmured Wainwright, and stepped back with a slight cough. He reached to shake Hal&#x2019;s hand, but glanced briefly back at Grey. His eyes were also brown, but not at all like his stepfather&#x2019;s, Grey thought, the momentary shock of recognition fading.<br><br>They were a soft, vivid brown, like sherry sack, and most expressive. At the moment, they were dancing with mirth at the situation&#x2014;and filled with the same intensely personal interest Grey had seen in them once before, at their first meeting . . . in the library of Lavender House.<br><br>Percy Wainwright had given him his name&#x2014;and his hand&#x2014;upon that occasion, too. But Grey had been an anonymous stranger then, and the encounter had been necessarily brief.<br><br>Hal was expressing polite welcome to the newcomer, though giving him the sort of coolly professional appraisal he would use to sum up an officer new to the regiment.<br><br>Grey thought Wainwright stood up well to such scrutiny; he was well-built, dressed neatly and with taste, clear-skinned and clean-featured, with an attitude that spoke of both humor and imagination. Both traits could be dangerous in an officer, but on a personal level . . .<br><br>Wainwright seemed to be discreetly exercising his own curiosity with regard to Grey, flicking brief glances his way&#x2014;and little wonder. Grey smiled at him, now rather enjoying the surprise of this new &#x201c;brother.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I thank you,&#x201d; Wainwright said, as Hal concluded his welcome. He pulled his lingering attention away from Grey, and bowed to Hal. &#x201c;Your Grace is most . . . gracious.&#x201d;<br><br>There was an instant of stricken silence following that last, half-strangled word, spoken as Wainwright realized, a moment too late, what he had said.<br><br>Hal froze, for the briefest instant, before recovering himself and bowing in return.<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; he said, with impeccable politeness. &#x201c;Shall we dine, gentlemen?&#x201d;<br><br>Hal turned at once for the door, not looking back. And just as well, Grey thought, seeing the hasty exchange of gestures and glances between the general and his stepson&#x2014;horrified annoyance from the former, exemplified by rolling of the eyes and a brief clutching of the shabby wig; agonized apology by the latter&#x2014;an apology extended wordlessly to Grey, as Percy Wainwright turned to him with a grimace.<br><br>Grey lifted one shoulder in dismissal. Hal was used to it&#x2014;and it was his own fault, after all.<br><br>&#x201c;We are fortunate in our timing,&#x201d; he said, and smiled at Percy.

In fact, to his credit, Wildsmith adapts the story of Jesus's last days in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, allowing young readers to glean the substance from the paintings, symbolism, and, most likely, discussion with grownups who may be reading along. The donkey's-eye-view of the events allows a slightly different perspective from the standard, without being overly intrusive as a literary device. Lush jewel tones capture the richness of the narrative, and mesh in a strangely beautiful way with the simple paintings of Jesus, the angels, Mary Magdalene, and others in the biblical cast of characters. <i>The Easter Story</i> will make a gorgeous addition to any Easter basket. (Ages 5 and older)</p>Brian Wildsmith was brought up in the mining village of Penistone, near Sheffield, England, and he attended the Slade School of Fine Art. Upon completing his studies, Brian made use of his love of music and skill as a pianist in the National Service, teaching music at the Royal School of Music. He became an art teacher after the National Service but soon gave up teaching to fulfill his true ambition, painting. <p>Brian began working with children&#x2019;s books in the 1960s, designing book covers for Oxford University Press. There, he was asked to illustrate a book entitled ABC which received the Kate Greenaway Medal in 1962 and is now in its 19th American edition. He has since illustrated more than sixty books for children.

Now with new material, <em>Going Rogue </em>offers plain talk from a true American original about her life, her career, and the future of the country she loves.</p></p><p><p>On September 3, 2008 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gave a speech at the Republican National Convention that electrified the nation and instantly made her one of the most recognizable women in the world.</p><p> As chief executive of America&#x2032;s largest state, she had built a record as a reformer who cast aside politics-as-usual and pushed through changes other politicians only talked about: Energy independence. Ethics reform. And the biggest private sector infrastructure project in U.S. history. While revitalizing public school funding and ensuring the state met its responsibilities to seniors and Alaska Native populations, Palin also beat the political "good ol&#x2032; boys club" at their own game and brought Big Oil to heel. </p><p> Like her GOP running mate, John McCain, Palin wasn&#x2032;t a packaged and over-produced "candidate." She was a Main Street American woman: a working mom, wife of a blue collar union man, and mother of five children, the eldest of whom was serving his country in a yearlong deployment in Iraq and the youngest, an infant with special needs. Palin&#x2032;s hometown story touched a populist nerve, rallying hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to the GOP ticket.</p><p> But as the campaign unfolded, Palin became a lightning rod for both praise and criticism. Supporters called her "refreshing," "honest," a kitchen-table public servant they felt would fight for their interests. Opponents derided her as a wide-eyed Pollyanna unprepared for national leadership. But none of them knew the real Sarah Palin.</p><p> In this eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up in the wilds of Alaska; meeting her lifelong love; her decision to enter politics; the importance of faith and family; and the unique joys and trials of life as a high-profile working mother.

The Civil War was raging. Dickinson was thirty-one; Higginson, thirty-eight. A former pastor at the Free Church of Worcester, Massachusetts, he wrote often for <i>the</i> cultural magazine of the day, <i>The</i> <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>&#x2014;on gymnastics, women&#x2019;s rights, and slavery. His article &#x201c;Letter to a Young Contributor&#x201d; gave advice to readers who wanted to write for the magazine and offered tips on how to submit one&#x2019;s work (&#x201c;use black ink, good pens, white paper&#x201d;).<br><br>Among the letters Higginson received in response was one scrawled in looping, difficult handwriting. Four poems were enclosed in a smaller envelope. He deciphered the scribble: &#x201c;Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?&#x201d;<br><br>Higginson read the poems. The writing was unique, uncategorizable. It was clear to him that this was &#x201c;a wholly new and original poetic genius,&#x201d; and the memory of that moment stayed with him when he wrote about it thirty years later.<br><br>Emily Dickinson&#x2019;s question inaugurated one of the least likely correspondences in American letters&#x2014;between a man who ran guns to Kansas, backed John Brown, and would soon command the first Union regiment of black soldiers, and the eremitic, elusive poet who cannily told him she did not cross her &#x201c;Father&#x2019;s ground to any House or town.&#x201d;<br><br>For the next quarter century, until her death in 1886, Dickinson sent Higginson dazzling poems, almost one hundred of them&#x2014;many of them her best. Their metrical forms were unusual, their punctuation unpredictable, their images elliptical, innovative, unsentimental. Poetry torn up by the roots, Higginson later said, that &#x201c;gives the sudden transitions.&#x201d;<br><br>Dickinson was a genius of the faux-na�f variety, reclusive to be sure but more savvy than one might imagine, more self-conscious and sly, and certainly aware of her outsize talent. &#x201c;Dare you see a Soul at the &#x2018;White Heat&#x2019;?&#x201d; she wondered. She dared, and he did.<br><br>In this shimmering, revelatory work, Brenda Wineapple re-creates the extraordinary, delicate friendship that led to the publication of Dickinson&#x2019;s poetry. And though she and Higginson met face-to-face only twice (he had never met anyone &#x201c;who drained my nerve power so much,&#x201d; he said), their friendship reveals much about Dickinson, throwing light onto both the darkened door of the poet&#x2019;s imagination and a corner of the noisy century that she and Colonel Higginson shared.<br><br><i>White Heat</i> is about poetry, politics, and love; it is, as well, a story of seclusion and engagement, isolation and activism&#x2014;and the way they were related&#x2014;in the roiling America of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Brenda Wineapple is the author of <i>Genet: A Biography of Janet Flanner; Sister Brother: Gertrude and Leo Stein; </i>and <i>Hawthorne: A Life</i>, winner of the Ambassador Award of the English-Speaking Union for Best Biography of 2003.

Thomas Wentworth Higginson opened the cream-colored envelope as he walked home from the post office, where he had stopped on the mild spring morning of April 17 after watching young women lift dumbbells at the local gymnasium. The year was 1862, a war was raging, and Higginson, at thirty-eight, was the local authority on physical fitness. This was one of his causes, as were women's health and education. His passion, though, was for abolition. But dubious about President Lincoln's intentions--fighting to save the Union was not the same as fighting to abolish slavery-- he had not yet put on a blue uniform. Perhaps he should.<br><br>Yet he was also a literary man (great consolation for inaction) and frequently published in the cultural magazine of the moment, <i>The Atlantic Monthly, </i>where, along with gymnastics, women's rights, and slavery, his subjects were flowers and birds and the changing seasons.<br><br>Out fell a letter, scrawled in a looping, difficult hand, as well as four poems and another, smaller envelope. With difficulty he deciphered the scribble. "Are you too deeply occupied to say if my Verse is alive?"<br><br>This is the beginning of a most extraordinary correspondence, which lasts almost a quarter of a century, until Emily Dickinson's death in 1886, and during which time the poet sent Higginson almost one hundred poems, many of her best, their metrical forms jagged, their punctuation unpredictable, their images honed to a fine point, their meaning elliptical, heart-gripping, electric. The poems hit their mark. Poetry torn up by the roots, he later said, that took his breath away.<br><br>Today it may seem strange she would entrust them to the man now conventionally regarded as a hidebound reformer with a tin ear. But Dickinson had not picked Higginson at random. Suspecting he would be receptive, she also recognized a sensibility she could trust--that of a brave iconoclast conversant with botany, butterflies, and books and willing to risk everything for what he believed.<br><br>At first she knew him only by reputation. His name, opinions, and sheer moxie were the stuff of headlines for years, for as a voluble man of causes, he was on record as loathing capital punishment, child labor, and the unfair laws depriving women of civil rights. An ordained minister, he had officiated at Lucy Stone's wedding, and after reading from a statement prepared by the bride and groom, he distributed it to fellow clergymen as a manual of marital parity.<br><br>Above all, he detested slavery. One of the most steadfast and famous abolitionists in New England, he was far more radical than William Lloyd Garrison, if, that is, radicalism is measured by a willingness to entertain violence for the social good. Inequality offended him personally; so did passive resistance. Braced by the righteousness of his cause--the unequivocal emancipation of the slaves--this Massachusetts gentleman of the white and learned class had earned a reputation among his own as a lunatic. In 1854 he had battered down a courthouse door in Boston in an attempt to free the fugitive slave Anthony Burns. In 1856 he helped arm antislavery settlers in Kansas and, a loaded pistol in his belt, admitted almost sheepishly,<br>"I enjoy danger." Afterward he preached sedition while furnishing money and morale to John Brown.<br><br>All this had occurred by the time Dickinson asked him if he was too busy to read her poems, as if it were the most reasonable request in the world.<br><br>"The Mind is so near itself--it cannot see, distinctly--and I have none to ask--" she politely lied. Her brother, Austin, and his wife, Susan, lived right next door, and with Sue she regularly shared much of her verse. "Could I make you and Austin--proud--sometime--a great way off--'twould give me taller feet--," she confided. Yet Dickinson now sought an adviser unconnected to family. "Should you think it breathed--and had you the leisure to tell me," she told Higginson, "I should feel quick gratitude--."<br><br>Should you think my poetry <i>breathed; quick gratitude: </i>if only he could write like this.<br><br>Dickinson had opened her request bluntly. "Mr. Higginson," she scribbled at the top of the page. There was no other salutation. Nor did she provide a closing. Almost thirty years later Higginson still recalled that "the most curious thing about the letter was the total absence of a signature." And he well remembered that smaller sealed envelope, in which she had penciled her name on a card. "I enclose my name--asking you, if you please--Sir--to tell me what is true?" That envelope, discrete and alluring, was a strategy, a plea, a gambit.<br><br>Higginson glanced over one of the four poems. "I'll tell you how the Sun rose-- / A Ribbon at a time--." Who writes like this? And another: "The nearest Dream recedes--unrealize--." The thrill of discovery still warm three decades later, he recollected that "the impression of a wholly new and original poetic genius was as distinct on my mind at the first reading of these four poems as it is now, after thirty years of further knowledge; and with it came the problem never yet solved, what place ought to be assigned in literature to what is so remarkable, yet so elusive of criticism." This was not the benign public verse of, say, John Greenleaf Whittier. It did not share the metrical perfection of a Longfellow or the tiresome "priapism" (Emerson's word, which Higginson liked to repeat) of Walt Whitman. It was unique, uncategorizable, itself.<br><br>The <i>Springfield Republican, </i>a staple in the Dickinson family, regularly praised Higginson for his <i>Atlantic </i>essays. "I read your Chapters in the Atlantic--" Dickinson would tell him. Perhaps at Dickinson's behest, her sister-in-law had requested his daguerreotype from the <i>Republican</i>'s editor, a family friend. As yet unbearded, his dark, thin hair falling to his ears, Higginson was nice looking; he dressed conventionally, and he had grit.<br><br>Dickinson mailed her letter to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he lived and whose environs he had lovingly described: its lily ponds edged in emerald and the shadows of trees falling blue on a winter afternoon. She paid attention.<br><br>He read another of the indelible poems she had enclosed.<br><i>Safe in their Alabaster Chambers--</i><br><i>Untouched by Morning--</i><br><i>And untouched by noon--</i><br><i>Sleep the meek members of the Resurrection,</i><br><i>Rafter of Satin and Roof of Stone--</i><br><i>Grand go the Years,</i><br><i>In the Crescent above them--</i><br><i>Worlds scoop their Arcs--</i><br><i>And Firmaments--row--</i><br><i>Diadems--drop--</i><br><i>And Doges--surrender--</i><br><i>Soundless as Dots,</i><br><i>On a Disc of Snow.</i><br><br>White alabaster chambers melt into snow, vanishing without sound: it's an unnerving image in a poem skeptical about the resurrection it proposes. The rhymes drift and tilt; its meter echoes that of Protestant hymns but derails. Dashes everywhere; caesuras where you least expect them, undeniable melodic control, polysyllabics eerily shifting to monosyllabics. Poor Higginson. Yet he knew he was holding something amazing, dropped from the sky, and he answered her in a way that pleased her.<br><br>That he had received poems from an unknown woman did not entirely surprise him. He'd been getting a passel of mail ever since his article "Letter to a Young Contributor" had run earlier in the month. An advice column to readers who wanted to become <i>Atlantic </i>contributors, the essay offered some sensible tips for submitting work--use black ink, good pens, white paper--along with some patently didactic advice about writing. Work hard. Practice makes perfect. Press language to the uttermost. "There may be years of crowded passion in a word, and half a life in a sentence," he explained. "A single word may be a window from which one may perceive all the kingdoms of the earth. . . . Charge your style with life." That is just what he himself was trying to do.<br><br>The fuzzy instructions set off a huge reaction. "I foresee that 'Young Contributors' will send me worse things than ever now," Higginson boasted to his editor, James T. Fields, whom he wanted to impress. "Two such specimens of verse came yesterday &amp; day before--fortunately <i>not </i>to be forwarded for publication!" But writing to his mother, whom he also wanted to impress, Higginson sounded more sympathetic and humble. "Since that Letter to a Young Contributor I have more wonderful expressions than ever sent me to read with request for advice, which is hard to give."<br><br>Higginson answered Dickinson right away, asking everything he could think of: the name of her favorite authors, whether she had attended school, if she read Whitman, whether she published, and would she? (Dickinson had not told him that "Safe in their Alabaster Chambers" had appeared in <i>The Republican </i>just six weeks earlier.) Unable to stop himself, he made a few editorial suggestions. "I tried a little,-- a very little--to lead her in the direction of rules and traditions," he later reminisced. She called this practice "surgery."<br><br>"It was not so painful as I supposed," she wrote on April 25, seeming to welcome his comments. "While my thought is undressed-- I can make the distinction, but when I put them in the Gown--they look alike, and numb." As to his questions, she answered that she had begun writing poetry...</p><h2>Xeriscape Color Guide: 100 Water-Wise Plants for Gardens and Landscapes</h2><p>Designed to be used as a companion to <i>Xeriscape Plant Guide</i>, this book helps gardeners and landscapers design colorful, practical and water-wise environments.<br></p><p>&#34;This is the best collaborative publishing project I have ever seen...You don&#39;t have to live in the high-desert plateau to benefit; by the way, the book also features many interesting native plants that would add to almost any garden.&#34;</p><h2>On Paper: The Everything of Its Two-Thousand-Year History (ALA Notable Books for Adults)</h2><p><p><b>A Best Book of the Year: <i>Mother Jones</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bloomberg News,</i>&nbsp;<i>National Post</i>,&nbsp;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>&nbsp;</b><br><br>A consideration of all things paper&#x2014;its invention that revolutionized human civilization; its thousand-fold uses (and misuses), proliferation, and sweeping influence on society; its makers, shapers, collectors, and pulpers&#x2014;written by the admired cultural historian and author of the trilogy on all things book-related: <i>A Gentle Madness;</i> <i>Patience and Fortitude</i> (&#x201c;How could any intelligent, literate person not just love this book?&#x201d;&#x2014;Simon Winchester); and <i>A Splendor of Letters </i>(&#x201c;Elegant, wry, and humane&#x201d;&#x2014;Andr� Bernard, <i>New York Observer</i>).<br><br> Nicholas Basbanes writes about paper, from its invention in China two thousand years ago to its ideal means, recording the thoughts of Islamic scholars and mathematicians that made the Middle East a center of intellectual energy; from Europe, by way of Spain in the twelfth century and Italy in the thirteenth at the time of the Renaissance, to North America and the rest of the inhabited world.<br><br> Basbanes writes about the ways in which paper has been used to record history, make laws, conduct business, and establish identities . . .

Basbanes</b></p> <p><strong>Q. What inspired you to write <i>On Paper</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. After writing eight books about every conceivable aspect of books and book culture, it seemed logical that I turn to the stuff of transmission itself, and for more than five hundred years in the West &#x2013; and much longer than that in Asia and the Middle East &#x2013; the medium of choice has been paper. The actual idea to write a book about paper, though, was suggested to me in 2002 by MacArthur Fellow Timothy Barrett, during a speaking visit I made to the Iowa Center for the Book at the University of Iowa. I spent several days there with Tim &#x2013; a world-renowned authority in the field of hand papermaking &#x2013; and he regaled me with stories about its history that I found irresistible. The best part about it, from my standpoint, was that no book quite like the decidedly eclectic one I ultimately envisioned had ever been done before. This is not a formal chronology by any means, but a cultural history that takes in the full sweep of this remarkably versatile material, and discusses the impact it has had on the shaping of history.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can anyone date the first appearance of an actual book?</strong></p> <p>A. By &#x201c;actual book,&#x201d; I assume you mean a &#x201c;book on paper,&#x201d; in which case the earliest known printed book to have an actual date on it is the <i>The Diamond Sutra</i>, from 868 A.D., printed on paper from carved wooden blocks, and produced more than five hundred years before Johannes Gutenberg introduced moveable metal type in Europe. It was found in a cave in the Gobi Desert early in the twentieth century by the explorer Sir Aurel Stein, and is now in the British Library. But books have taken many shapes and forms over the centuries, the earliest ones written on clay tablets in Mesopotamia dating to about 3000 B.C. Others have been written on cured animal skins known as parchment and vellum, on laminated strips of a marsh reed known as papyrus, others have been incised on bamboo, silk, metal sheets, pottery, stone &#x2013; whatever material was available at the time. But once introduced as a viable medium &#x2013; and once the rudiments for making it from the pulverized fibers of a vegetative source were understood &#x2013; paper transformed everything. It was cheap to make, it was light, pliable, resilient, portable, foldable &#x2013; truly a miracle invention with a multitude of applications.</p> <p><strong>Q. This is a big question, I know, but what do you think have been paper&#x2019;s greatest contributions to history?</strong></p> <p>A. I think the fact that paper has been the medium upon which so much of our history, our literature, and our cultural heritage have been recorded for close to a thousand years, and the medium upon which each generation over that span has been able to communicate with those that follow, has to come first. Of the eighteen chapters in my book, the one I chose to be the title chapter is devoted to this concept. Another deals with the role paper has played as a tool of the creative process, with generous attention given to the notebooks of Leonard da Vinci, Beethoven, and Thomas Edison. But paper has done so many other remarkable things, it is almost impossible to single out one function as being stronger than all the others. Architecture as we know it today, for instance, or engineering in which plans must be drawn precisely to scale, the making of photographic images, the emergence in Ottoman times of the modern bureaucracy, are unthinkable without the availability of this remarkable material.</p> <p><strong>Q. You write that &#x201c;the paperless society we hear being bandied about so much today may not be as imminent as some people suggest.&#x201d; How so?</strong></p> <p>A. There&#x2019;s a wonderful quote I use as an epigraph to one of the chapters, an observation made in the 1980s by a historian of libraries named Jesse Shera. &#x201c;The paperless society,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is about as probable as the paperless bathroom.&#x201d; Many functions of paper definitely are on the wane, and we all know what they are, books, newspapers, correspondence, record-keeping and the like. But those account for just a fraction of the functions that paper facilitates, currency, toilet paper, photographic prints, wrapping paper, cardboard packaging, labels, food containers &#x2013; it&#x2019;s all paper &#x2013; and I don&#x2019;t see many substitutes for those products immediately on the horizon.</p> <p><strong>Q. What role do you see paper playing in the future?</strong></p> <p>A. There&#x2019;s a company based in Pennsylvania, P. H. Glatfelter, that has more than tripled its business in barely a decade, and is now a $1.6 billion-a-year company, and they did it by diversifying to the point that they make paper for more than a thousand different commercial uses &#x2013; paper for tea bags, postage stamps, greeting cards, candy wrappers, copying machines, while also supplying high-quality paper for use in the publishing industry. The companies that are going to survive and prosper, I believe, are the companies that have the will and the perception to seek out and serve a variety of niche markets such as these.</p> <p><strong>Q. The smart phone has become our generation&#x2019;s diary, newspaper, novel, notepad, planner and so much more. What do you see as the benefits and drawbacks to this transition?</strong></p> <p>A. I think future generations may regret the absence of hard-copy diaries, journals, correspondence and the like from people living an exclusively electronic kind of life. These are artifacts that give us so much information about the way people think and how they live at a particular point in time, and to eliminate them as a resource for future scholars is a palpable loss. Think of what we would have missed if John and Abigail Adams had texted each other digitally during the years of the Revolution, and not written the kind of letters that truly span the centuries, or if their son, John Quincy Adams, had not kept a daily diary from the time he was twelve to a few days before he died in 1848 at the age of eighty. I write in my chapter on governmental red tape how the National Archives is working to develop reliable ways to insure that electronic records are stored in ways that they will be preserved permanently in standard formats, and &#x201c;readable&#x201d; to future researchers. In fact that&#x2019;s the biggest challenge professional archivists face today, the long-term conservation of &#x201c;born digital&#x201d; materials.</p>Nicholas A.

Takahashi's best gift might be that of characterization. The situations in this, the second volume of <i>Ranma 1/2</i> stories, all center around characters who seem fully human because so many subtle character traits are perceptible. Filled with action (this one deals with an ice-skating competition) and balanced with tenderness (a character's embarrassing first kiss), it's no wonder these stories are so universally loved.The spotlight on Rumiko Takahashi's career began in 1978 when she won an honorable mention in Shogakukan's annual New Comic Artist Contest for Those Selfish Aliens. Later that same year, her boy-meets-alien comedy series, Urusei Yatsura, was serialized in Weekly Shonen Sunday. This phenomenally successful manga series was adapted into anime format and spawned a TV series and half a dozen theatrical-release movies, all incredibly popular in their own right. Takahashi followed up the success of her debut series with one blockbuster hit after another--Maison Ikkoku ran from 1980 to 1987, Ranma 1/2 from 1987 to 1996, and Inuyasha from 1996 to 2008. Other notable works include Mermaid Saga, Rumic Theater, and One-Pound Gospel. Takahashi won the Shogakukan Manga Award twice in her career, once for Urusei Yatsura in 1981 and the second time for Inuyasha in 2002.

Black &amp; white photos.</p><p>The male nude has been a staple of art since the Greeks graced their public buildings with the glorified forms of gods and heroes. Renaissance artists didn't hesitate to display the male form, particularly in churches; the past 100 years of photography have seen a resurgence of the male nude. Nonetheless, until now there's been very little critical analysis of these nudes' homoerotic content. In his Lambda Award-winning <i>Naked Men: Pioneering Male Nudes 1935-1955</i>, David Leddick uses intensive research, interviews, and photographic representations to uncover sources and inspirations for the male nude through 20 years of contemporary art. Relying on the words and visual work of hundreds of artists, models, and writers (including George Platt Lynes, Paul Cadmus, Tennessee Williams, and Gore Vidal), Leddick conjures up the images, history, and social context of the mid-20th-century homoerotic nude. Filled with photos and reproductions, <i>Naked Men</i> shows us how gay sensibilities and gay culture have freed the male body from social restraints in both art and everyday life. Leddick's <i>The Male Nude</i>, while not strictly a companion volume, does similar work, detailing more than a century of male nudes. As with <i>Naked Men</i>, this book is lavishly and beautifully illustrated. Both are important documents of gay male history and culture. <i>--Michael Bronski</i><b>David Leddick</b> began his career as a dancer at the Metropolitan Opera of New York and subsequently worked as a creative director for Revlon and L'Or�al advertising.

Like many people who grew up enslaved, Addy doesn&#39;t know when she was born, so M&#39;dear urges Addy to claim a day for her birthday. Then M&#39;dear falls ill. When Addy goes out to get medicine, she faces prejudice--and danger. M&#39;dear helps Addy overcome her anger and gives her a deeper understanding of freedom. When Addy finally claims a birthday, it is a special day indeed, and the whole city celebrates.</p><p>Grade 3-5-The story of Addy and her family, who have escaped from slavery, continues in these two stories set in Philadelphia just before and after the end of the Civil War. Happy Birthday, Addy opens with the protagonist leading a more stable life with her father now delivering ice and searching for a carpenter's position and her mother taking in laundry. Although both parents are being paid as free citizens, the realities of prejudice are clearly evident as Addy laments, "all the colored people got a strange kind of freedom here...There are jobs we can't get and shops we can't eat at just because of the color of our skin." Despite this, she learns the value of optimism from wise, old, blind M'Dear. Addy Saves the Day includes the excitement of a church fair sponsored for postwar family assistance and Abby helping to catch the thief who steals the raised monies. Both books have a good balance of emotion, historical facts, and suspense to keep readers interested; they are attractively illustrated with colorful vignettes and full-page paintings. An addendum, "A Peek Into the Past," provides a good explanation of the time period and its customs, conventions, and realities.

We learn, through Pike's own eyes, how his childhood made him the way he is today. It's also about a friendship so strong that it threatens Elvis's relationship with his beloved Lucy. It is a tender but dark book--a serial killer book--but it doesn't attempt to outgross the other serial killer books on the shelf.

That is the basic question of economics. When economist and philosopher Adam Smith proclaimed that all our actions were motivated by self-interest, he used the example of the baker and the butcher as he laid the foundations for 'economic man.' He argued that the baker and butcher didn't give bread and meat out of the goodness of their hearts. It's an ironic point of view coming from a bachelor who lived with his mother for most of his life &#x2015; a woman who cooked his dinner every night. <p>Nevertheless, the economic man has dominated our understanding of modern-day capitalism, with a focus on self-interest and the exclusion of all other motivations. Such a view point disregards the unpaid work of mothering, caring, cleaning and cooking. It insists that if women are paid less, then that's because their labor is worth less. Economics has told us a story about how the world works and we have swallowed it, hook, line and sinker. This story has not served women well. Now it's time to change it.</p><p>A kind of femininst <em>Freakonomics</em>, <em>Who Cooked Adam Smith&#x2019;s Dinner?</em> charts the myth of economic man &#x2015; from its origins at Adam Smith's dinner table, its adaptation by the Chicago School, and its disastrous role in the 2008 Global Financial Crisis &#x2015; in a witty and courageous dismantling of one of the biggest myths of our time.</p></p><p>Katrine Mar�al&nbsp;is a journalist for the Swedish newspaper&nbsp;Dagens Nyheter, where she writes about economics, finance and politics. She lives in a village north of London.&#x201c;An exciting reassessment of the global economy that provocatively extends the frontiers of the feminist critique.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A spirited and witty manifesto. Commanding rhetoric punctuated with spiky wit.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>New Statesman</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Katrine Mar�al&#x2019;s searing new book exposes the flaws of classical economics and its modern incarnations and in particular its missionary zeal to subordinate all other human aims at the altar of the market. With wit and a hefty dose of anger, she tells a convincing story of the history of economic man. A powerful, and entertaining, story.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Prospect Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Thoughtfully challenges conventional assumptions about work, productivity, and value. An enjoyable read, and dryly witty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Baffler</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Mar�al&#x2019;s romp through the development of the field and the work of Smith, Keynes, Freud, the Chicago School, and Lawrence Summers (among others) is as diverting as it is thoughtful, especially as she points out the gaping hole at its center: the places where self-interest and the market can&#x2019;t quite reach. Midway through her book, Mar�al writes about Betty Friedan&#x2019;s The Feminine Mystique &#x2015; in its own way, this vivid, entertaining work is equally groundbreaking.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A smart, funny, readable book on economics, money [and] women.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margaret Atwood (on Twitter)</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A no-holds-barred critique of how modern economic theory has largely excluded the contributions of women.

Mar�al&#x2019;s analysis chronicles how this system of capitalism came to exist and demonstrates why the idea of the economic man may no longer be a solid fit.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Victorian London society is shocked by the bizarre killing of General Thaddeus Carlyon during a dinner party at the elegant home of Maxim and Louisa Furnival. Even more shocking is the admission of Alexandra, the General's wife, that she had murdered him in a jealous rage. Meanwhile, Carlyon's sister Edith is convinced that Alexandra had another motive, one powerful enough to save her from the gallows. She enlists the help of stalwart friend Hester Latterly, who brings into the case famed lawyer Oliver Rathbone and ex-police officer Thomas Monk (The Face of a Stranger, A Dangerous Mourning). Together, they delicately probe the lives of the Carlyon family--Thaddeus's father, a retired colonel; his daughter; forbidding mother Felicia; high-strung daughter Isabella, and young son Cassian. The uncovering of Alexandra's secret is slowed by repetitious interviews, constant underlining of the period social mores, and Monk's tortuous exploration of his own past, lost to amnesia after an accident some time back. But the pace quickens as Alexandra's trial draws near, and the story ends in a courtroom drama loaded with vigor, tension, and poignancy--ample reward for the patient reader. Overall: another winner in this fine series. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

From age spots, body odor, chronic fatigue, erectile dysfunction and hair loss to midlife crisis, pot bellies, sagging breasts, tick removal, yellowed teeth and zits, health writer Thomas, in collaboration with naturopathic physician Beth Wotton, tackles myriad health problems with natural remedies. The introduction warns that the book shouldn&#x2019;t replace a doctor&#x2019;s expertise, but many entries complement recipes for salubrious herbal teas, for example, with common sense diet and exercise advice. Suffering from insomnia? Try a catnip tea, block out night noises and wind down with a bedtime ritual. "Finding the Sahara where there used to be a sexy swamp?" asks the chapter on menopause. Consume soy products and red clover tea for their estrogenic effects. Thomas takes an informal, sympathetic tone: exclamations of "yow!" and "aaarrrgghh!" pepper the book, which seems aimed at aging baby boomers encountering the afflictions of maturity.

Casey, a central figure in the World War II spy operations of CIA precursor OSS, had a successful career as a tax lawyer and inventor of the tax shelter, as chair of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, and as Reagan's campaign manager.

In this authorized biography, Persico challenges Bob Woodward's rather harsh interpretation of Casey in Veil ( LJ 12/87), especially criticizing Woodward's covert visit to Casey's hospital bedside. Persico finds the roots of Casey's life in his Queens, New York childhood, his OSS work, and his hero, OSS head "Wild Bill" Donovan. While still not the definitive biography of Casey only time can produce, this book will appeal to readers of Woodward's book.

The author describes how Casey restored the morale and effectiveness of the CIA, but shows that, due to his role in the Iran- contra affair, Casey left the Agency in virtually the same demoralized state in which he found it in 1981. The final quarter of the biography offers an account that notably clarifies the Iran- contra fiasco. 50,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/ promo; author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Board Stiff (A Mattie Winston Mystery)</h2><p>"The funniest deputy coroner to cut up a corpse since, well, ever." --Laura Levine<br><br>Sorenson, Wisconsin's deputy coroner Mattie Winston is back on the job. . .in a nursing home examining the body of Bernie Chase--the now former president of the Twilight Home's board of directors--who is covered in a powder used to turn liquids to solids.

As the novel opens, Billy, after viewing a show of Vel�zquez paintings, is so humbled and awed by their spiritual power that he suffers an emotional breakdown and withdraws to his Chelsea loft. In seclusion, Billy searches for the divine spark in his own work and life. Carroll's novel moves back and forth in time to present emblematic moments from Billy's life (his Irish Catholic upbringing, his teenage escapades, his evolution as an artist and meteoric rise to fame) and sharply etched portraits of the characters who mattered most to him, including his childhood friend Denny MacAbee, now a famous rock musician; his mentor, the unforgettable art dealer Max Bernbaum; and one extraordinary black bird. Marked by Carroll's sharp wit, hallucinatory imagery, and street-smart style, <i>The Petting Zoo</i> is a frank, haunting examination of one artist's personal and professional struggles.</p><p>Jim Carroll&#x2019;s bestselling memoir <i>The Basketball Diaries</i> was first released in 1978 and adapted as a film in 1995. Carroll&#x2019;s work includes several collections of poetry as well as a asecond memoir, <i>Forces Entries: The Downtown Diaries 1971-1973</i>. As the leader of The Jim Carroll Band he released three albums as well as several spoken word recordings. He died in New York City on September 11, 2009.<b>1</b><p>All the trouble, of course, began with Vel�zquez. Billy Wolfram was running recklessly down the wide steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Craning his head backward, he saw the huge banner with the old master's self-portrait hanging from the limestone fa�ade. Billy was certain those cocksure eyes were fixed directly on him. Mocking him. The slick leather soles of his new shoes slid beneath him, but he recovered before falling. He sped up, watching the yellow streaks of cabs passing down Fifth Avenue. Then he turned his eyes upward to the lights swinging over the traffic like hanging torsos, frozen on red. He heard snatches of conversations from men poised on the steps, smoking in tuxedos: "So I told her it looked more like a pie chart." "I don't get these old masters...; there's something so <i>Catholic</i> about them...;"</p><p>He took the last nine steps three at a time, then sped south on Fifth Avenue until he reached the entrance to Central Park. His legs were straining to outrun the images in his brain and find some equilibrium in speed. A doctor friend once told Billy that he was prone to "racing thoughts." He moved slower now on the path beside the dog run, sweating through the seat of his tuxedo trousers. He was thinking about the sound of traffic out of view, and how alien the body seemed, how senseless and capricious. Nauseous, he started shaking so badly he wanted to collapse into the grass and rest, anything to lose the images of Vel�zquez, every detail in his paintings, every brushstroke now stuck in loops of racing thoughts.</p><p>He wondered what kind of man the old master was. Billy knew little about Vel�zquez in any biographical sense. Staring up at the trees, he resolved to change that, vowing to thoroughly research the maestro's life by the next day.</p><p>Billy Wolfram fixed his eyes directly at the sky, which was filmy and disguised by the lights and melancholy of the city. The cause of his outrageous behavior that night wasn't buried in some biographer's footnotes, but in the paintings themselves. It was their spirituality and haunting arrogance that had attacked Billy. The characters in the paintings still shouted out, and the volume grew until their seventeenth century voices sent him dropping to his knees. As if genuflecting in prayer, he remained in the grass and the sound of peasants, cardinals, and children of the aristocracy continued to taunt him now for the shortcomings in his own work and his frivolous life.</p><p>Billy raised himself up, returned to the path, and moved on. He had no idea how much time had passed, but despite the knees of his pants being soaked, he felt calmer. Some of the lampposts gave off light, others had been snuffed out by vandals' stones flung through the opaque casing. It was the type of bare, low light that encouraged danger and disguise, but in his present state of mind, rejuvenated by his rest in the grass, Billy walked south on the pathway without qualms or fear.</p><p>Moving through one of those semicircular brick underpasses, the ground filled with puddles and the walls with moss no matter what the weather, Billy recognized that, in his circumstances, there was no better place for him to be. In these shadows, this part of the park had no reference to time or place. He passed a homeless old couple sleeping beneath strips of cardboard. They looked up at him, both toothless, the man with a patchy gray beard. They could have been from any era or country...; the French Revolution, resting after a day among the crowds gathered to watch the guillotine do its work, finding their only entertainment in its simplicity and precision.</p><p>He was speeding up, his body finally falling comfortably into place with his mind's delirious, disheveled drive. <i>It's amazing and terrible</i>, he thought, <i>distinguishing the ironies out of control within you, and not being able to do a thing about them</i>. What he needed was something to take his mind in another direction.</p><p>There was a fork in the path; Billy recognized that the turn to the left led to the zoo, remembering for no reason that the Latin word for "left" was "sinister." Within minutes, he was on a hill overlooking the zoo.</p><p>This was fate, he thought; this was exactly what he needed. Billy had loved zoos all his life. The Central Park Zoo was antiquated. It hadn't expanded its cages for the spacious simulacra of natural habitats that many modern zoos boasted. Nonetheless, there was a unique sensation walking around its minimal confines. It was the counterpoint of all those wild, exotic creatures existing right alongside the aloof residents of obscenely priced buildings on Fifth Avenue. Creatures strutting with such certainty a few short blocks away from the neurotic and trendy. This was what passed for irony in midtown Manhattan. It was all the irony people wanted in their lives, and it was all they could handle.</p><p>Halfway down the path leading into the main zoo's north entrance, Billy was confronted by an orange DayGlo sign, surrounded by a chain-link fence: CLOSED FOR RENOVATIONS.</p><p>Billy circumnavigated the barricaded site by following the grass beside the carriage path leading directly to the petting zoo. He picked up a flyer and read that it was still operating despite the reconstruction of the larger zoo. The fact that it would be closed for the night did not bother him in the least. Billy knew that animals would provide the perfect diversion to redirect his obsessed thoughts, and nothing was going to stop him from that necessity. He stopped for a moment and looked down at what remained of the old zoo. The tall spiked fence that once enclosed the polar bear still stood, and the huge centerpiece, the pool for sea lions, was all drained and dry. It wasn't as deep as he had imagined when he watched the seals circling the gray water and diving down until they were out of view. Now there were just two homeless men, barely visible in the moon shadows.</p><p>Though most of the lion house had been leveled, some of the cages were still intact. Billy felt the ghostly presence of cheetahs restlessly pacing. Beyond the brick tier of the monkey house, which remained standing, he could see the petting zoo. He moved down the rocks toward it. He could feel the animal spirits diffusing the dilemma of Vel�zquez, but not completely. The streetlight from Fifth Avenue played on the red and yellow leaves of the trees, and in them he saw the canvases from the museum. If he stood before a painting long enough, Billy had always thought he could reconstruct every moment of its creation. He could tell which were the starting strokes, the defining cuts of a palette knife, the transcendent afterthoughts in the thickness of pigment. It was as if he were standing in the painter's studio with him. Yet, despite the strange, shocking quality that he had seen in the maestro's canvases tonight, recreated now in the trees, he couldn't pull off that feat...; not with Vel�zquez. He was blocked. "This is how it should be," he whispered to himself, before stumbling down the hill to the petting zoo.</p><p>There was a metal shutter closing off the entrance, secured at the base by a huge padlock. In his current state of mind, this didn't bother Billy. He walked around the side, where his only obstruction to the zoo grounds and the animals was an old black metal fence. Actually, at second glance, it looked rather imposing...; a row of ten-foot-high rods, sharpened at the top. There was an old elm to Billy's left, however, growing right up against the outside of the fence. It might as well have been a stairway leading to a slide into the zoo. Its limbs were low to the ground, extending outward into the zoo, only about ten feet from the pond, where a duck floated alone in the dazed, diffused moonlight.</p><p>He climbed the tree with ease, but once he reached a suitable height to scale the fence, it was somewhat trickier finding a branch that would both carry him into the zoo and support his weight. He tested one, and though it began to bend precariously, he realized it would only take one more step before he could lower himself into the zoo. He took it, and the branch snapped beneath him, quickly and loud. Billy lurched forward, miraculously sidestepping the pond and landing on his feet. His tuxedo was barely wrinkled. It was amazing.</p><p>Billy surveyed the place, walking toward the glass-encased pavilion at the entrance. The lampposts offered just enough light for him to see clearly, accentuating the atmosphere of the place. The little zoo was a remnant of a bygone architectural age the Candy Land school, circa Cold War 1950s. It had a theme, an odd mixture of fairy-tale and biblical references, and abounded with details. There were the "Three Little Piggies," with houses of wood, straw, and brick. Of course, the actual pigs themselves lived in a rusting tin A-frame and were hardly little, but gigantic sows, pushing the 300-pound mark. They were also extremely unattractive, their bodies a bloated pink, with a few bristly clumps of thick hair.</p><p>There was a small Noah's ark, cantilevered out over the entrance to the pond. The pond was the centerpiece of the petting zoo, normally filled with ducks and geese. Near that was an exhibit of tropical fish housed within a glass window encased in a huge blue whale. The whale looked like something on top of an Eisenhower-era drive-in restaurant with waitresses on roller skates. Most of the fish were dead or dying. The whale's exterior paint was peeling badly, but its schizophrenic eyes still stared above a lunatic white smile.</p><p>The petting zoo rattled Billy's painterly instincts. On the day it opened, everything about it had had a postwar flamboyance, the colors lurid, artificial, and bright. Now, from time and the city's exhaust, they had faded like the decorations on a birthday cake that had sat far too long in a bakery window.</p><p>There were ponies in their red stable, locked away for the night, along with a recalcitrant llama that was fond of&#x2014;and accurate at&#x2014;spitting on onlookers while standing in his cramped, sorry quarters. The tops of the lampposts were shaped like buttercups. There was a black wrought-iron birdcage crowned with a wire sculpture of a robin swallowing a worm. This cage was fairly large but hardly large enough for the two fully grown birds inside, hunched sullenly on their perches.</p><p>Billy didn't have to break into Noah's ark, since there was no door on it. He quietly slouched up the gangplank and entered. There were ten small cages. Eight were empty; the other two held two shaggy rabbits. They looked rabid. "Rabid rabbits," Billy whispered to the cowering bunnies. It was a fairly pathetic attraction. Why did they call it a <i>petting zoo</i>? he wondered. Everything was encased; you couldn't pet these rabbits if you wanted to, and it was doubtful anyone would. Still, Billy reached a single finger through the wire mesh as best he could, and one of the furry creatures actually moved closer. With the tip of his pinky, Billy managed to flick off some of the ubiquitous crud caked beneath its left eye. He tried to get to the other eye to clean it as well, but the rabbit withdrew to the back of the cage. That was enough time for Noah's ark, and he headed for the exit.</p><p>About to step onto the gangplank, he forgot to duck while moving through the kiddie-sized doorway. Crack! Billy smashed his head just above his eyebrows. He saw brilliant comets emerging and cracking apart from a deep cherry-red background. The red then dissipated and was replaced by spirals of nausea. He almost went out, his legs buckling beneath him as he reached out blindly and grabbed on to the wood casing of an empty cage.</p><p>Lowering himself to one knee, Billy waited for his head to clear. He was thankful that the impact had thrown him backward rather than straight ahead. He imagined the embarrassment of tumbling forward down the gangplank of Noah's ark, directly into the pond, flopping and splashing about, not to mention the ancillary pain of being attacked by obstinate geese. He hesitantly checked his forehead as he began to rise, squeamish about confronting the size of the lump. It was large, worse than he expected. Also, there was blood on his hand lots of it. He could now feel its slow traverse downward into his eyes and past his nose. It was time to leave.</p><p>Billy came to a halt near the birdcage. He gave a quick look around and, to his dismay, discovered that he was trapped inside the petting zoo. There were no trees growing from the inside over the fence, so he was not going to be leaving the way he got in. He decided to circle the edges and see what his options were. On the outside edges of the zoo, dozens of trees grew right beside the fence, but there wasn't the scrawniest sapling rising within the zoo to help Billy boost his way over the fence.</p><p>He was about five feet past the cage when he first heard the voice: "Quite a whack you got there, eh?" It was a strange-sounding voice, and though it was slightly high-pitched, he knew immediately that it was male. Billy chalked it up to the effects of a mild concussion. Billy heard the voice again, this time infinitely more distinct: "You have to remember where you are, and when to duck. A painter should have a better understanding of scale. By the way, if you're lost for a way out, there's a ladder over there leaning against the ponies' so-called stable."</p><p>Billy turned around to face the birdcage only a few feet behind him. It was the only place that the sound could have come from. He circled the structure and found nothing and nobody. He surveyed every direction and there was no hint of any speakers, microphones, or amplifiers. Besides, there was nothing electronic, no matter how sophisticated, about that voice. In the cage were perched a sparrow hawk and a raven, the raven's talons dug so deeply into a wood branch that the bird could have been stuffed. Nonetheless, as Billy looked down, he could have sworn his peripheral vision caught the black bird opening and closing one eye. Quickly turning back, he saw the bird's eyes were once more tightly shut. Now, Billy assumed, he was dealing with visual as well as auditory delusions.</p><p>It was all some form of passing insanity, he was about to conclude, but whoever had done the speaking in this elaborate trick was, thankfully, as good as his word. Across the park and in the shadows, Billy saw a large painter's ladder on the side of the red pony stable. He turned and headed for it. As he was dragging the aluminum ladder toward the tree where he had entered, Billy heard the voice one more time: "I'll be seeing you soon. Good luck with your quest."</p><p>Billy found a path leading out onto Fifth Avenue. He crossed it and began speeding across 64th Street toward Madison. The voice was right, he thought; he did have a quest before him. Only now he wasn't just seeking equilibrium in speed, but sanity as well. His thoughts were racing, but his legs could no longer keep up with his brain. He was exhausted. He stopped at the traffic island on glittering Park Avenue, looking downtown, the chain of lights there, red, yellow, and all that green, all ending with the golden-lit fa�ade of the huge Helmsley Building. It seemed like an Aztec temple. They offered their heroes and losers to the gods. All the colors kept repeating, mixing with racing thoughts of bloody Azte...</p></p><h2>Personal Disciplemaking: A Step by Step Guide for Leading a Christian from New Birth to Maturity</h2><p>A serious resource for those who are involved in a Christian discipleship ministry.

Andrew Dalby&#39;s &#34;Tastes of Byzantium&#34; now reveals in astonishing detail, for the first time, what was eaten in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire - and how it was cooked. Fusing the spices of the Romans with the seafood and simple local food of the Aegean and Greek world, the cuisine of the Byzantines was unique and a precursor to much of the food of modern Turkey and Greece. Bringing this vanished cuisine to life in vivid and sensual detail, Dalby describes the sights and smells of Constantinople and its marketplaces, relates travellers&#39; tales and paints a comprehensive picture of the recipes and customs of the empire and their relationship to health and the seasons, love and medicine. For food-lovers and historians alike, &#34;Tastes of Byzantium&#34; is both essential and riveting - an extraordinary illumination of everyday life in the Byzantine world.</p><p>Andrew Dalby is a classical scholar, historian, linguist and translator most well-known for his books on the history of food, in particular the Greek and Roman empires.

With a compassionate yet critical eye, William Scott Wilson delves into the workings of Musashi's mind as the iconoclastic samurai wrestled with philosophical and spiritual ideas that are as relevant today as they were in his times. Musashi found peace and spiritual reward in seeking to perfect his chosen Way, and came to realize that perfecting a single Way, no matter the path, could lead to fulfillment. <em>The Lone Samurai</em> is far more than a vivid account of a fascinating slice of feudal Japan. It is the story of one man's quest for answers, perfection, and access to the Way.<br><br>By age thirteen, Miyamoto Musashi had killed his opponent in what would become the first of many celebrated swordfights. By thirty, he had fought more than sixty matches, losing none. He would live another thirty years but kill no one else. He continued to engage in swordfights but now began to show his skill simply by thwarting his opponents' every attack until they acknowledged Musashi's all-encompassing ability. At the same time, the master swordsman began to expand his horizons, exploring Zen Buddhism and its related arts, particularly ink painting, in a search for a truer Way. <br><br>Musashi was a legend in his own time. As a swordsman, he preferred the wooden sword and in later years almost never fought with a real weapon. He outfoxed his opponents or turned their own strength against them. At the height of his powers, he began to evolve artistically and spiritually, becoming one of the country's most highly regarded ink painters and calligraphers, while deepening his practice of Zen Buddhism. He funneled his hard-earned insights about the warrior arts into his spiritual goals. Ever the solitary wanderer, Musashi shunned power, riches, and the comforts of a home or fixed position with a feudal lord in favor of a constant search for truth, perfection, and a better Way. Eventually, he came to the realization that perfection in one art, whether peaceful or robust, could offer entry to a deeper, spiritual understanding. His philosophy, along with his warrior strategies, is distilled in his renowned work, <em>The Book of Five Rings</em>, written near the end of his life. <br><br>Musashi remains a source of fascination for the Japanese, as well as for those of us in the West who have more recently discovered the ideals of the samurai and Zen Buddhism. <em>The Lone Samurai</em> is the first biography ever to appear in English of this richly layered, complex seventeenth-century swordsman and seeker, whose legacy has lived far beyond his own time and place.<br>---------------------------------------------------------------- INTERVIEW WITH WILLIAM SCOTT WILSON ABOUT BUSHIDO<br><br>Q.: What is Bushido?<br><br>A.: Bushido might be explained in part by the etymology of the Chinese characters used for the word. Bu comes from two radicals meanings "stop" and "spear." So even though the word now means "martial" or "military affair," it has the sense of stopping aggression. Shi can mean "samurai," but also means "gentleman" or "scholar." Looking at the character, you can see a man with broad shoulders but with his feet squarely on the ground. Do, with the radicals of head and motion, originally depicted a thoughtful way of action. It now means a path, street or way. With this in mind, we can understand Bushido as a Way of life, both ethical and martial, with self-discipline as a fundamental tenet. Self-discipline requires the warrior at once to consider his place in society and the ethics involved, and to forge himself in the martial arts. Both should eventually lead him to understand that his fundamental opponents are his own ignorance and passions.<br><br>Q.: How did the code develop and how did it influence Japanese society? <br><br>A.: The warrior class began to develop as a recognizable entity around the 11th and 12th centuries. The leaders of this class were often descended from the nobility, and so were men of education and breeding. I would say that the code developed when the leaders of the warrior class began to reflect on their position in society and what it meant to be a warrior. They first began to write these thoughts down as yuigon, last words to their descendents, or as kabegaki, literally "wall writings," maxims posted to all their samurai. Samurai itself is an interesting word, coming from the classical saburau, "to serve." So when we understand that a samurai is "one who serves," we see that the implications go much farther than simply being a soldier or fighter.<br><br>Also, it is important to understand that Confucian scholars had always reflected on what it meant to be true gentleman, and they concluded that such a man would be capable of both the martial and literary. The Japanese inherited this system of thought early on, so certain ideals were already implicitly accepted. <br><br>The warrior class ruled the country for about 650 years, and their influence-political, philosophical and even artistic-had a long time to percolate throughout Japanese society.<br><br>Q.: The Samurai were very much renaissance men - they were interested in the arts, tea ceremony, religion, as well as the martial arts. What role did these interests play in the development of Bushido? How did the martial arts fit in? <br><br>A.: This question goes back to the Confucian ideal of balance that Japanese inherited, probably from the 7th century or so. The word used by both to express this concept, for the "gentleman" by the Chinese and the warrior by Japanese, is (hin), pronounced uruwashii in Japanese, meaning both "balanced" and "beautiful." The character itself is a combination of "literature" (bun) and "martial" (bu). The study of arts like Tea ceremony, calligraphy, the study of poetry or literature, and of course the martial arts of swordsmanship or archery, broadened a man's perspective and understanding of the world and, as mentioned above, provided him with a vehicle for self-discipline. The martial arts naturally were included in the duties of a samurai, but this did not make them any less instructive in becoming a full human being. <br><br>Q.: What was sword fighting like? Was the swordplay different for different samurai? <br><br>A.: There were literally hundreds of schools of samurai swordsmanship by the 1800's and, as previously mentioned, each school emphasized differing styles and approaches. Some would have the student to jump and leap, others to keep his feel solidly on the ground; some would emphasize different ways of holding the sword, others one method only. One school stated that technical swordsmanship took second place to sitting meditation. Historically speaking, there were periods when much of the swordfighting was done on horseback, and others when it was done mostly on foot. Also, as the shape and length of the sword varied through different epochs, so did styles of fighting. Then I suppose that a fight between men who were resolved to die would be quite different from a fight between men who were not interested in getting hurt. <br><br>Q.: How is the code reflected in Japanese society today? <br><br>A.: When I first came to live in Japan in the 60's, I was impressed how totally dedicated and loyal people were to the companies where they were employed. When I eventually understood the words samurai and saburau, it started to make sense. While these men (women would usually not stay long with a company, giving up work for marriage) did not carry swords of course, they seemed to embody that old samurai sense of service, duty, loyalty and even pride. This may sound strange in our own "me first" culture, but it impressed me that the company had sort of taken the place of a feudal lord, and that the stipend of the samurai had become the salary of the white-collar worker.M<br><br>That is on the societal level. On an individual level, I have often felt that Japanese have a strong resolution, perhaps from this cultural background of Bushido, to go through problems rather than around them. Persistence and patience developed from self-discipline?</p><p>THE TRUE STORY OF JAPAN&#x2019;S GREATEST SAMURAI SWORDSMAN AND THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK OF FIVE RINGS<br><strong>William Scott Wilson</strong> was born in 1944 and grew up in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. As an undergraduate student at Dartmouth College in 1966, he was invited by a friend to join a three-month kayak trip up the coast of Japan from Shimonoseki to Tokyo. This eye-opening journey, beautifully documented in National Geographic, spurred Wilson's fascination with the culture and history of Japan.<br><br>After receiving a B.A. degree in political science from Dartmouth, Wilson earned a second B.A. in Japanese language and literature from the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies in Monterey, California, then undertook extensive research on Edo-period (1603-1868) philosophy at the Aichi Prefectural University, in Nagoya, Japan.<br><br>Wilson completed his first translation, Hagakure, while living in an old farmhouse deep in the Japanese countryside. <em>Hagakure</em> saw publication in 1979, the same year Wilson completed an M.A. in Japanese language and literature at the University of Washington. Wilson's other translations include <em>The</em> <em>Book of Five Rings</em>, <em>The Life-Giving Sword</em>, <em>The Unfettered Mind</em>, the Eiji Yoshikawa novel <em>Taiko</em>, and Ideals of the Samurai, which has been used as a college textbook on Japanese history and thought. Two decades after its initial publication, <em>Hagakure</em> was prominently featured in the Jim Jarmusch film <em>Ghost Dog</em>.<br></p><h2>Three&#39;s Company, Five&#39;s a Crowd (Tokyo Mew-Mew, Vol. 2)</h2><p>Seventh-grader Ichigo and her fellow Tokyo Mew Mew members, three other girls who have had their DNA merged with the DNA of nearly extinct animals, try to convince the fifth member of their team to join them in saving the world.</p><p></p><h2>Rules for Aging: Resist Normal Impulses, Live Longer, Attain Perfection</h2><p>Acclaimed and beloved prize-winning essayist Roger Rosenblatt has commented on most of the trends and events of our time.

Now, at the dawn of a new millennium, Rosenblatt offers the American people a survival manual-fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. It doesn't matter: Whatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life. It does not matter if you are late, or early; if you are having a bad hair day, or a no hair day; if your boss looks at you cockeyed, or if you are cockeyed; if you don't get that promotion, or if you do. It doesn't matter. Nobody is thinking about you: Yes, I know, you are certain that your friends are becoming your enemies; that your grocer, garbageman, clergyman, sister-in-law, and your dog are all of the opinion that you have put on weight. You are also sure that everyone spends two-thirds of every day commenting on your moral disintegration, denigrating your work, plotting your murder. I promise you: Nobody is thinking about you. They are thinking about themselves-just like you. A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.<br></p><p>What? A how-to-make-your-life-better-book with more than the ubiquitous seven ways of doing so? In <i>Rules for Aging: Resist Normal Impulses, Live Longer, Attain Perfection</i>, acclaimed essayist and <i>NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i> regular contributor Roger Rosenblatt boldly offers up a whopping 56 rules for wisely navigating life into your golden years.<p> Rosenblatt describes the short book (only 140 pages), which began with a column he wrote for <i>Modern Maturity</i>, as a "little guide intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all." He adds that "growing older is as much an art as it is a science, and it requires fewer things to do than not to do."</p><p> Ranging from the fatalistic (rule 1: "It doesn't matter") to the highly practical (rule 26: "Never go to a cocktail party and, in any case, do not stay more than 20 minutes"), rule 2 best illustrates the tone for much of what follows ("Nobody is thinking about you"):</p><p> </p><blockquote>Yes, I know, you are certain that your friends are becoming your enemies; that your grocer, garbage man, clergyman, sister-in-law, and your dog are all of the opinion that you have put on weight, that you have lost your touch, that you have lost your mind; furthermore, you are convinced that everyone spends two-thirds of every day commenting on your disintegration, denigrating your work, plotting your assassination. I promise you: Nobody is thinking about you. They are thinking about themselves--just like you.</blockquote><p> Other notables include "Let bad enough alone" (rule 3), "Stay clear of anyone--other than a clergyman--who refers to God more than once in an hour" (rule 8), "Do not attempt to improve anyone, especially when you know it will help" (rule 29), "The unexamined life lasts longer" (rule 40), "Change no more than one-eighth of your life at a time" (rule 48), and "The game is played away from the ball" (rule 55). Nowhere will you find talk of antioxidants or exercise or anything resembling a detox program. Rosenblatt is no health nut, and there is already plenty of material available on that. What you will encounter instead is a gifted writer clearly enjoying his craft, making this slim volume a welcome poke at and departure from the more predictable antiaging fare. <i>--Patrick Jennings</i></p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2000, 0-15-100659-8 <br></p><h2>Harmony</h2><p>Walter Piston was a Professor at Harvard University when this book was written.

I think I'll ask him if I can pick my own selection, the next time his publishers are slapping several titles together. If it really must be just a single book: <i>A Song for Arbonne</i> by Guy Gavriel Kay. <br><br></p><p> The CD: Cheating time again. <i>Your Hundred Best Tunes</i> (London label, two 4-CD sets, but a dearly loved and now-vanished store, The Madrigal, once sold them taped together, in a brick of glorious music).

Not just because I'd love to know the truth, or at least their side, of various family tales, events, and disputes. Not just because I desperately want to know more of their characters, and spend more time with them. It's also because they were gushing, articulate fonts of knowledge about times now gone, the daily customs and attitudes and aspirations of "then." The saying: "There were MEN in those days" comes to mind. And no, I'm not belittling the women of the family. They <i>did</i> talk to me, at eloquent length, before passing away. They knew the importance of sharing and passing lore on. <br><br></p><p> <b>Q:</b> If you could have one superpower what would it be?<br></p><p> <b>A:</b> The power to read people's minds, at very close range and only when I tried to. Not to read bank account numbers or anything of the sort, but to know their true feelings, so as not to offend and so I can best make them happy. Spreading happiness has to be the most heroic thing ordinary folk can daily do. <br><br></p>ED GREENWOOD, creator of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, is the best-selling author of hundreds of stories, games products, novels, and articles set in the world of Faer�n.

It describes with accuracy and perspective the long development of both the integral and the differential calculus from their early beginnings in antiquity to their final emancipation in the 19th century from both physical and metaphysical ideas alike and their final elaboration as mathematical abstractions, as we know them today, defined in terms of formal logic by means of the idea of a limit of an infinite sequence.<br>But while the importance of the calculus and mathematical analysis &#x2015; the core of modern mathematics &#x2015; cannot be overemphasized, the value of this first comprehensive critical history of the calculus goes far beyond the subject matter. This book will fully counteract the impression of laymen, and of many mathematicians, that the great achievements of mathematics were formulated from the beginning in final form. It will give readers a sense of mathematics not as a technique, but as a habit of mind, and serve to bridge the gap between the sciences and the humanities. It will also make abundantly clear the modern understanding of mathematics by showing in detail how the concepts of the calculus gradually changed from the Greek view of the reality and immanence of mathematics to the revised concept of mathematical rigor developed by the great 19th century mathematicians, which held that any premises were valid so long as they were consistent with one another. It will make clear the ideas contributed by Zeno, Plato, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, the Arabic and Scholastic mathematicians, Newton, Leibnitz, Taylor, Descartes, Euler, Lagrange, Cantor, Weierstrass, and many others in the long passage from the Greek "method of exhaustion" and Zeno's paradoxes to the modern concept of the limit independent of sense experience; and illuminate not only the methods of mathematical discovery, but the foundations of mathematical thought as well.</p><p></p><h2>Surveying: Principles and Applications</h2><p><p> <i>SURVEYING: PRINCIPLES &amp; APPLICATIONS, 9/e</i>&nbsp;is the clearest, easiest to understand, and most useful introduction to surveying as it is practiced today.

In these highly individual, penetrating essays he has exposed 'the American whole soul' within some of that continent's major works of literature. In seeking to establish the status of writings by such authors as Poe, Melville, Fenimore Cooper and Whitman, Lawrence himself has created a classic work. Studies in Classic American Literature is valuable not only for the light it sheds on eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American consciousness, telling 'the truth of the day', but also as a prime example of Lawrence's learning, passion and integrity of judgement.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

This volume offers the final 1923 version of the text in a newly corrected and uncensored form, as well as earlier, often very different, versions of many of the essays, and a host of other materials, including four different versions of Lawrence&#39;s pioneering essay on Whitman.<b>D.H. Lawrence</b> (1885-1930), English novelist, storywriter, critic, poet and painter, one of the greatest figures in 20th-century English literature. Among his works, <i>Sons and Lovers</i> appeared in 1913, <i>The Rainbow</i> in 1915, <i>Women In Love</i> in 1920, and many others.</p><h2>Life and Miracles of St. Benedict (Book Two of the Dialogues)</h2><p><p>A translation of the biography written by Pope Gregory the Great, this official biography is also known as the Second Book of Dialogues.

This historical novel tells the story of the quest for the True Cross through fifty years of the most exciting events in Roman and Christian history.The narrative begins when the Tribune Constantius, a Roman officer stationed in Britain, meets and wins Helena, only daughter of the mystical and oracular King Coel of Britain. Through the course of their early lives together, and during their ten-year separation when Constantius returns to Britian as a conquering Caesar and Helena has become a rejected wife, devoted mother, and militant Christian, there is a sure and convincing portrayal of character growth and personal conflict. Helena's fierce determination to raise Constantine as a warrior son and her gradual discovery and dramatic acceptance of Christianity prepare her for the final miracle of her life discovery of the True Cross, the Living Wood on Calvary. <i>The Living Wood</i> is a chapter from the turbulent half-forgotten pages of early Christian history and legend in which the religious conflicts and problems are handled with moving simplicity. It is also an action-packed novel of those times--with a lesson for us today--that captures with equal skill and tumult and the shouting of the battlefield and the devious plots and counter-plots of the court.</p><p>Louis de Wohl wrote numerous historical novels for adults, including &#34;The Living Wood&#34;, which is also about St. Helena and Constantine. He earned international acclaim for The Spear, and among his other popular titles are &#34;Lay Siege to Heaven, The Restless Flame, The Joyful Beggar &#34;and &#34;The Quiet Light.&#34;</p><h2>Guardians of the West (The Malloreon, Book 1)</h2><p><b>Here, in the eagerly awaited sequel to David Eddings&#x2019; bestselling&nbsp;<i>The Belgariad,&nbsp;</i>is the first book of&nbsp;<i>The Malloreon,&nbsp;</i>an epic quest across strange lands and among stranger peoples&#x2014;a magnificent fantasy of men, Kings, Sorcerers, and Gods caught up in the culmination of the seven-thousand-year war between two opposing Destinies to determine the fate of all creation.</b><br><br>Garion had slain the evil God Torak and been crowned King of Riva.

Eleven years passed.<br><br>Then suddenly the Voice of Prophecy cried out a warning:&nbsp;&#x201c;Beware Zandramas!&#x201d; Not even Belgarath the Sorcerer knew who or what Zandramas was. But Garion discovered hints in a previously obscured part of the Mrin Codex. Worse, he learned that the Dark Prophecy was still waging its ancient struggle against the Prophecy of Light.

And again, Garion found himself a pawn, caught between the two ancient Prophecies, with the fate of the world somehow resting on him.</p><p>A sequel to THE BELGARIAD, Garion has slain the evil God Torak, and fulfilled the prophecy.

He rose to prominence in Rome, pursuing a career in the courts and political life, for which he had been trained, while also acquiring celebrity as an author of tragedies and essays. Falling foul of successive emperors (Caligula in AD 39 and Claudius in AD 41), he spent eight years in exile, allegedly for an affair with Caligula&#x2019;s sister. Recalled in AD 49, he was made praetor and was appointed tutor to the boy who was to become, in AD 54, the emperor Nero. On Nero&#x2019;s succession, Seneca acted for some eight years as an unofficial chief minister. The early part of this reign was remembered as a period of sound government, for which the main credit seems due to Seneca. His control over Nero declined as enemies turned the emperor against him with representations that his popularity made him a danger, or with accusations of immorality or excessive wealth. Retiring from public life he devoted his last three years to philosophy and writing, particularly the <b>Letters to Lucilius</b>. In AD 65 following the discovery of a plot against the emperor, in which he was thought to be implicated, he and many others were compelled by Nero to commit suicide. His fame as an essayist and dramatist lasted until two or three centuries ago, when he passed into literary oblivion, from which the twentieth century has seen a considerable recovery.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Working-Class War: American Combat Soldiers and Vietnam</h2><p>No one can understand the complete tragedy of the American experience in Vietnam without reading this book.

That Dorky Homemade Look: Quilting Lessons from a Parallel Universe is the quilting companion you've been wishing for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa Boyer, a popular columnist for Quilting Today magazine, gives you permission to quilt because you love it. She clears your path of all those merciless judgments pronounced by the Quilting Queens. She invites you to make quilts that are full of life. This funny book offers these nine principles for the 20 million quilters in America:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Pretty fabric is not acceptable. Go right back to the quilt shop and exchange it for something you feel sorry for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Realize that patterns and templates are only someone's opinion and should be loosely translated. Personally, I've never thought much of a person who could only make a triangle with three sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. When choosing a color plan for your quilt, keep in mind that the colors will fade after a hundred years or so. This being the case, you will need to start with really bright colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. You should plan on cutting off about half your triangle or star points. Any more than that is showing off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. If you are doing applique, remember that bigger is dorkier. Flowers should be huge. Animals should possess really big eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Throw away your seam ripper and repeat after me: "Oops. Oh, no one will notice."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Plan on running out of border fabric when you are three-quarters of the way finished. Complete the remaining border with something else you have a lot of, preferably in an unrelated color family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. You should be able to quilt equally well in all directions. I had to really work on this one. It was difficult to make my forward stitching look as bad as my backward stitching, but closing my eyes helped.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. When you have put your last stitch in the binding, you are still only half finished. Your quilt must now undergo a thorough conditioning. Give it to someone you love dearly&#x2014;to drag around the house, wrap up in, spill something on, and wash and dry until it is properly lumpy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No reason not to have quiltmaking be a pleasure", says Lisa Boyer, who has as firm a grip on her sense of humor as she does on her quilting needles. "If we didn't make Dorky Homemade quilts, all the quilts in the world would end up in the Beautiful Quilt Museum, untouched and intact. Quilts would just be something to look at. We would forget that quilts are lovable, touchable, shreddable, squeezable, chewable, and huggable -- made to wrap up in when the world seems to be falling down around us."</p><p><br>Lisa Boyer became a self-taught quilter at the age of eight, patching together a salesman&#x2019;s book of bedspread swatches with her toy sewing machine. She only took a few years off as she earned her degree in microbiology, worked as a clinical laboratory scientist, then became a sewing-machine mechanic, pattern designer, quilt teacher, writer, magazine columnist, and mother. Her varied interests have led her to write articles on such diverse topics as quilting, hurricanes, vegetables, shoes, and sewing-machine repair, just to name a few. Known to her friends as &#x201c;the mad quilt scientist,&#x201d; Lisa combines her love of quilting with her background in science and psychology, resulting in some strangely unique philosophies. Her first book, That Dorky Homemade Look&#x2014;Quilting Lessons from a Parallel Universe, was written as a tribute to all the lovely, but less-than-perfect, quilts and quilters everywhere. Lisa&#x2019;s articles have appeared in Kauai Magazine and the Orange County Register, in addition to her regular column in Quiltworks Today Magazine. Lisa&#x2019;s quilts have appeared in Quilting Today, Quiltworks Today, Miniature Quilts and Kauai magazines. She also made a guest appearance on HGTV&#x2019;s &#x201c;Simply Quilts.&#x201d; Lisa Boyer is a native of southern California. She now lives in Hawaii on the island of Kauai with her husband, a clockmaker by avocation, and their son.That Dorky Homemade Look <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a mixed bag of quilting friends. There are some who enjoy quilts as fine art, especially contemporary quilts with their innovative forms and use of color. Some of my friends are strictly traditional. They love the familiar Ohio Stars and Log Cabins and never tire of making them in different colors and settings. Some really love the primitive country look with its plaid backgrounds and charmingly-cut crooked stars. There are many styles to be drawn to, and some beginners dabble in every kind of style before they find their niche. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, it took me 10 whole years of dabbling before I found my quilting identity. Why so long? Because I had to find my own style. As a matter of fact, I had to invent it. I call it the "Dorky Homemade Look." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know what you are thinking. I am not the first person to ever make a Dorky Homemade Quilt. But maybe I will be the first person to define the category as a bona fide art form. I believe this is the first step in public acceptance of the homemade dorky quilt genre, and I have elected myself the spokesperson. As the chief quilt dork, let me outline the steps necessary to make a quilt according to the current Dorky Homemade Quilt guidelines: </p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pretty fabric is not acceptable. Go right back to the quilt shop and exchange it for something you feel sorry for. </p><p>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realize that patterns and templates are only someone&#x2019;s opinion and should be loosely translated. Personally, I&#x2019;ve never thought much of a person who could only make a triangle with three sides. </p><p>3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When choosing a color plan for your quilt, keep in mind that the colors will fade after a hundred years or so. This being the case, you will need to start with really bright colors. </p><p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should plan on cutting off about half your triangle or star points. Any more than that is showing off. </p><p>5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are doing applique, remember that bigger is dorkier. Flowers should be huge. Animals should possess really big eyes. </p><p>6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throw away your seam ripper and repeat after me: "Oops. Oh well, no one will notice." </p><p>7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plan on running out of border fabric when you are three-quarters of the way finished. Complete the remaining border with something else you have a lot of, preferably in an unrelated color family. </p><p>8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should be able to quilt equally well in all directions. I had to really work on this one. It was difficult to make my forward stitching look as bad as my backward stitching, but closing my eyes helped. </p><p>9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most important aspect to remember about dorky homemade quilt-making is that once you have put your last stitch in the binding, you are still only half-finished. The quilt must now undergo a thorough conditioning. Give it to someone you love dearly. They must drag it around the house, wrap themselves up in it when they have a fever, spill something brown on it, and occasionally let Woofie lay on it. It must be washed and dried until it is as soft and lumpy as my Thanksgiving mashed potatoes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I have described the Dorky Homemade Quilt, I&#x2019;m sure many of you are saying to yourself, "Oh yes, I&#x2019;ve seen one of those; it was covering Aunt Wilhelmina&#x2019;s tomatoes during the last frost," or something of the sort. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I hope you&#x2019;ve gained an appreciation for those of us who actually strive to make the quilts that never quite gain "heirloom" status. We deserve recognition for making the kind of quilts that your cat has kittens on, or Grampa Bob covers his tractor with. If we didn&#x2019;t make Dorky Homemade Quilts, all the quilts in the world would end up in the Beautiful Quilt Museum, untouched and intact. Quilts would just be something to look at. People would forget that quilts are lovable, touchable, shreddable, squeezable, chewable, huggable objects to wrap themselves up in when the world seems to fall down around them. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, in the interests of promoting the Dorky Homemade Quilt cause, I urge you to make at least one Dorky Homemade Quilt in honor of all the well-loved quilts that gave their lives for the advancement of our art. Or make one just because it feels good.</p></p><h2>Life in the Son</h2><p>"Seldom is a book published that reflects such bold independence of thought, such freedom from the fetters of tradition, and such complete objectivity in the study of the Scriptures. It is a book to be reckoned with by all serious students of the Bible."--from the Introduction by Dr. William W. Adams of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary<br>Internationally known among Bible scholars for his significant books in the field of biblical theology, Dr. Robert Shank here offers a penetrating study of all the pertinent New Testament Scriptures on the doctrine of perseverance. In doing so, he calls into question the popular doctrine of "eternal [unconditional] security."Are the proof passages used to support eternal security possibly misconstrued? Dr. Shank convincingly argues that the question confronting us is not, Is the believer secure? but rather, What does it mean to be a believer? If apostasy is an actual peril for every Christian, the Scriptural warning passages must be frankly accepted rather than interpreted into irrelevance or circumvented by theological hypothesis.</p><p>Dr. Robert Shank is known internationally among Bible scholars for his significant books in the field of biblical theology, which are used in seminaries and colleges of many denominations. He has been preaching and teaching in the pulpit, classroom, and visiting lectureships for over fifty years and his writings have been viewed as a major doctrinal contribution to the Church.</p><h2>The Lies That Bind: A Novel</h2><p><b>In the irresistible new novel from the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>All We Ever Wanted </i>and<i> Something Borrowed</i>, a young woman falls hard for an impossibly perfect man before he disappears without a trace. . . .&nbsp;</b><br><br> It&#x2019;s 2 A.M. on a Saturday night in the spring of 2001, and twenty-eight-year-old Cecily Gardner sits alone in a dive bar in New York&#x2019;s East Village, questioning her life.

It concerns unactualized human capabilities, opportunities and adventures for all of us in the years ahead. <p>For the first time, a rigorous experimental protocol is available to allow human qualities to meaningfully alter the properties of physical materials via specific human intentions! </p><p>The experimental data portion of this book shows, via the use of IIEDs (Intention Imprinted Electrical Devices), how human intention can robustly influence physical reality with measurement amplitude changes by as much as 100 times the instrument measurement accuracy. </p><p>The described experiments deal with inorganic materials like water, in vitro organic materials like enzymes and in vitro living systems like fruit fly larvae. </p><p>This experimental data shows how after ~3 months of continued use of the IIEDs in a particular laboratory space, that space becomes &#x201c;conditioned&#x201d; to a higher state of physics Gauge symmetry than present in normal locales. </p><p>In a &#x201c;conditioned&#x201d; space, human intention acts as a true thermodynamic potential to significantly influence the many chemical, electrical and biological processes of nature. </p><p>This book also provides a &#x201c;work in progress&#x201d; &#x2013; type of theoretical model that allows us to explain how this experimental procedure works to produce such striking changes in measurement amplitudes. </p><p>As Professor George Sudarshan (Physics Department, University of Texas, Austin) says: &#x201c;Your new book, I am sure, may long be remembered as the book that started out the scientific work in a new area and thus created a new era in science.&#x201d; </p><p>As Professor Rustum Roy (Director, Materials Research Laboratory, Pennsylvania State University) says: &#x201c;This book by Tiller, Dibble and Kohane is at once a &#x2018;magnum opus&#x2019; and a &#x2018;tour de force&#x2019;.

The beautiful Indo prostitute Dewi Ayu and her four daughters are beset by incest, murder, bestiality, rape, insanity, monstrosity, and the often vengeful undead. Kurniawan&#x2019;s gleefully grotesque hyperbole functions as a scathing critique of his young nation&#x2019;s troubled past:the rapacious offhand greed of colonialism; the chaotic struggle for independence; the 1965 mass murders of perhaps a million &#x201c;Communists,&#x201d; followed by three decades of Suharto&#x2019;s despotic rule.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>&nbsp;Beauty Is a Wound</em> astonishes from its opening line: One afternoon on a weekend in May, Dewi Ayu rose from her grave after being dead for twenty-one years....&nbsp; Drawing on local sources&#x2015;folk tales and the all-night shadow puppet plays, with their bawdy wit and epic scope&#x2015;and inspired by Melville and Gogol, Kurniawan&#x2019;s distinctive voice brings something luscious yet astringent to contemporary literature.</p><p><p>The internationally acclaimed author of <em>Beauty Is a Wound</em> and <em>Man Tiger</em>, <strong>Eka Kurniawan</strong> was born in West Java in 1975, the day that the little ex-Portuguese colony East Timor declared its sovereign independence.</p><p><strong>Annie Tucker</strong>&nbsp;won a PEN/Heim Translation Fund Award for her Eka Kurniawan translation.</p>&#x201c;Eka&#x2019;s approach in <em>Beauty...</em> mixes seriousness with irreverence, juxtaposing historical fact and magical realism in a manner reminiscent of Salman Rushdie.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Clarissa Oon, <em>ArtReview Asia</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An unforgettable, all-encompassing epic...

T. Wright</h2><p><p>N. T. Wright, a world-renowned New Testament scholar and bishop of Durham in the Church of England, has spent years studying the apostle Paul's writings and has offered a "fresh perspective" on Paul's theology. Among his conclusions are that "the discussions of justification in much of the history of the church-certainly since Augustine-got off on the wrong foot, at least in terms of understanding Paul-and they have stayed there ever since."</p><p>Wright's confidence that the church has gotten it wrong for 1,500 years, given his enormous influence, has set off warning bells for Christian leaders such as John Piper, a pastor and New Testament scholar. If Wright's framework for interpreting the New Testament text and his understanding of justification find a home in the church, not only could the doctrine of justification be distorted for generations to come, but the New Testament writers' original intent could be silenced. So Piper is sounding a crucial warning in this book, reminding all Christians to exercise great caution regarding "fresh" interpretations of the Bible and to hold fast to the biblical view of justification.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary.

O'Brien, </strong>Former Vice-Principal and Senior Research Fellow and Emeritus Faculty Member, Moore Theological College, Australia</p><p>"The so-called 'New Perspective on Paul' has stirred up enormous controversy.

A. Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>"In this captivating book John Piper defends the truth that justification is the heart of the gospel.

Schreiner,</strong> James Buchanan Harrison Professor of New Testament Interpretation, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary</p><p>"I am very grateful to John Piper, pastor-scholar par excellence, for helping me understand better the doctrines of justification and imputation.

For award-winning novelist David Guterson, it is also a metaphor for where we find ourselves in the middle of our lives, and his new narrative poem explores this idea through a lyrical journey along a trail, much like those in Washington&#x2019;s mountain ranges he hiked while growing up.<br><br> Even outdoor-lovers who are not normally readers of poetry will relate to the physicality of hiking represented here, from endless trail switchbacks to foot and ankle pains. There is a fast-moving, propulsive quality to David&#x2019;s writing, with lush language, vivid imagery, and pacing that resonates as a journey on foot. His words are brought further to life by the delicate yet mythical illustrations by award-winning artist Justin Gibbens.</p><p><b>David Guterson</b> is a novelist, short story writer, poet, essayist, and journalist.

They had other goals as well, some of them secret: converting the indigenous natives along the way to the true faith, discovering a semi-mythical paradise known as Teguay�, hunting for sources of gold and silver, and paving the way for Spanish settlements from Santa Fe to Monterey.</p><p>In strict terms, the expedition failed. Running out of food and beset by an early winter, the twelve-man team gave up in what is now western Utah. The retreat to Santa Fe became an ordeal of survival. The men were reduced to eating their own horses while they searched for a crossing of the raging Colorado River in Glen Canyon. Seven months after setting out, Dom�nguez and Escalante staggered back to Santa Fe. Yet in the course of their 1,700-mile voyage, the explorers discovered more land unknown to Europeans than Lewis and Clark would encounter a quarter-century later.</p><p>Other writers, using Escalante&#x2019;s brilliant and quirky diary as a guide, have retraced the expedition route, but David Roberts is the first to dig beneath its pages to question and ponder every turn of the team&#x2019;s decision-making and motivation.

The diversity of these two families of birds, and the ways in which they define and enrich the ecosystems they inhabit, are the subject of this vivid new book by photographer and naturalist Paul Bannick. <p>The Owl and the Woodpecker showcases a sense of these birds' natural rhythms, as well as the integral spirit of our wild places. Based on hundreds of hours in the field photographing these fascinating and wily birds, Bannick evokes all 41 North American species of owls and woodpeckers, across 11 key habitats. And by revealing the impact of two of our most iconic birds, Bannick has created a wholly unique approach to birding and conservation. * Perfect holiday book for all bird-watchers * An in-depth look at two of our most iconic--and important--bird species * Great for photography lovers, conservationists, and backyard enthusiasts alike * Includes a foreword by award-winning artist and writer Tony Angell</p></p><p>Award-winning photographer PAUL BANNICK specializes in the natural history imagery.

Gablik's thesis is not original. ``Since the Enlightenment,'' she maintains, ``our view of what is real has been organized around the hegemony of a technological and materialist world view...we no longer have any sense of having a soul.'' Spirituality and ritual have been the first casualties of this attitude, but the most profound reordering, Gablick says, has occurred in the area of social relations, as the spread of individualistic philosophies has weakened or destroyed the cohesion of traditional communal structures--leading to the modern artist understanding his or her vocation in terms of the objects created rather than the audience addressed. If the artist has any awareness of the audience at all, it is usually seen as a hostile force to be either ignored or shocked (this is the lesson Gablik draws from Richard Serra's Tilted Arc controversy). What is needed, we are told, is an aesthetics of ``interaction and connection,'' in which the artist works to restore the lost harmony between humanity and earth, and to override the alienation of race, sex, and class. At this point Gablik's argument falls into New Age obscurantism and is weakened further in that most of the exemplars of her approach (sculptors who design carts for the homeless, photographers who document toxic-waste dumping, etc.) sound more like social workers or advocacy lawyers than artists. A valuable analysis that brings forth incredible conclusions. Gablick has apparently fallen into a deconstructionist vocabulary that allows her to play fast-and-loose with concepts of ``art'' and ``creation,'' resulting in a confusion little better than the one she set out to overcome.

They have opened frontiers, founded cities, settled borders, and fed billions. They promote life, forge peace, grant power, and capriciously destroy everything in their path. And even as they have become increasingly domesticated, rivers remain a powerful global force, one that is more critical than ever to our future.<br><br>In <i>Rivers of Power</i>, geographer Laurence C. Smith takes a deep dive into the timeless and vastly underappreciated relationship between rivers and civilization as we know it. Rivers are of course important to us in all the obvious ways (like water supply, sanitation, transport, etc.). But they also shape us in less obvious ways. Massive amounts of river water support the global food trade; huge volumes are consumed to provide the world's electricity -- not just by hydropower, but by coal, nuclear, and natural gas power plants too; most of our globally important cities are positioned on the banks of rivers or river deltas. The territories of nations, their cultural and economic ties to one another, and the migrations of people trace to rivers and the topographic divides they carve on the world.<br><br>Beautifully told and expansive in scope, <i>Rivers of Power</i> reveals how and why rivers have so profoundly shaped civilization, and examines the importance this vast, arterial power holds for our present, past, and future.</p><p><b>Laurence C.

The syncretic nature of Theosophy allowed for and even encouraged individualism in belief, making Theosophy a good fit for the notions of freedom and personal agency that characterized the American West in the popular imaginary. <br><br>Among those drawn to the American West seeking spiritual answers in the early 20th century were artists. In 2014, the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum at Utah State University staged the first exhibition to explore artistic responses to this confluence of enchanted thought and the American West. Building on this precedent, <i>Enchanted Modernities: Theosophy, the Arts and the American West</i> is the first publication devoted to studying these relationships in art and music. <br><br>Through a series of color plates, contextual essays, interviews and interpretations of individual works by artists such as the Dynaton group (Wolfgang Paalen, Gordon Onslow Ford, Lee Mullican), Oskar Fischinger, Emil Bisttram, Lawren Harris, Raymond Jonson, Agnes Pelton, Wolfgang Paalen, Beatrice Wood, Dane Rudhyar and Jess, <i>Enchanted Modernities</i> explores the role of Theosophical thought in redefining the relationship between enchantment and modernism, and fostering lively cultural networks in a region that that has long captured the world&#x2019;s imagination.</p></p><p>[Enchanted Modernities] charts Theosophy&#x2019;s influence on Western modernism.

This collection brings together more than two hundred letters to Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, John Clellon Holmes, and other Beat generation luminaries, as well as correspondence between Neal and his wife, Carolyn. These amazing letters cover Cassady&#x2019;s life between the ages of 18 and 41 and finish just months before his death in February 1968. Brilliantly edited by Dave Moore, this unique collection presents the &#x201c;Soul of the Beat Generation&#x201d; in his own words&#x2014;sometimes touching and tender, sometimes bawdy and hilarious.&nbsp; Here is the real Neal Cassady&#x2014;raw and uncut.</p></p><p>Neal Cassady (1926&#x2013;1968) was born on the side of the road in Salt Lake City and raised in Denver by an alcoholic father. On a trip to New York City in 1946, he encountered Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg on the campus of Columbia University, a meeting many consider the beginning of the Beat movement.Though he inspired the likes of Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, Beat icon Cassady never published a single book in his lifetime. A restless and uneven writer, he lacked the discipline of his more determined friends, noting himself in a 1948 letter to Kerouac, "My prose has no individual style as such...perhaps, words are not the way for me." But stylistically sound or not, Cassady&#x2019;s writing inspired a whole generation of authors, and, as evidenced by the copious letters he penned, his life was marked by artistic conflict and wanderlust. Compiling all of the thrice-married writer&#x2019;s correspondence into one volume for the first time, British editor Moore adeptly documents Cassady&#x2019;s rise from teenaged inmate at the Colorado State Reformatory to chauffeur for Ken Kesey&#x2019;s Merry Pranksters. Unfortunately, few of these letters record Cassady&#x2019;s most famous adventures, such as the cross-country trip with Kerouac that inspired On the Road. The vast majority of the epistles concern Cassady&#x2019;s failed love affairs and his inability to both keep a job and financially support his wives. Moore gives much needed historical commentary in places, although his decision to sporadically insert letters to Cassady from his ex-wives breaks up the flow of his subject&#x2019;s central narrative. Although there are a few literary gems within Cassady&#x2019;s body of work, such as his free-flowing "Joan Anderson" letter, for the most part, his letters prove that his most enduring legacy is his tremendous influence on his Beat friends. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Michael Kimmel challenges the claim that gender is limited to women's experiences--his compelling and balanced study of gender includes both masculine and feminine perspectives.<br><br>Kimmel makes three bold and persuasive statements about gender. First, he demonstrates that gender differences are often extremely exaggerated; in fact, he argues that men and women have much more in common than we think they do. Kimmel also challenges the pop psychologists who suggest that gender difference is the cause of inequality between the sexes; instead, he reveals that the reverse is true-gender inequality itself is the cause of the differences between men and women. Finally, he illustrates that gender is not merely an element of individual identity, but a socially constructed institutional phenomenon.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Kimmel </strong>is Distinguished Professor of Sociology at Stony Brook University, The State University of New York.

Kimmel does an excellent job of presenting the many facets of gender in the U.S."--Kathleen O'Reilly, <em>Three Rivers Community College</em> <br><p></p><br>"I like Kimmel's approach-rather than 'differences exist, therefore inequality,' Kimmel emphasizes the converse-that 'inequalities exist, therefore difference.' This subtle difference highlights the power aspect in a way that other texts do not do. Kimmel is excellent in his introduction of key concepts and terms. He does a great job, stylistically, of presenting material in a manner that is engaging and approachable."--Gregory Maddox, <em>Southern Illinois University Carbondale</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Casebook in Abnormal Psychology</h2><p>See disorders as they appear in real life with CASEBOOK IN ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY!

"The strengths of the anthology are the strengths of the entire series. The combination of primary documents and synthesis provide students with a blend that is apparent in ways it is not in other texts. The willingness to engage evolving interpretations and disagreements among historians is another strength that forces students to consider evidence and to provide meaningful analysis. Clearly, the combination of a wide range of scholars is another strength. The approach reinforces in students the notion that history is a dynamic subject, whose practitioners do more than relate facts."<br><br>"The selection of primary source materials perfectly illustrates the themes of each of the chapters.

The chapter sequencing and organization works well....It's wonderful to have such a comprehensive text that uses primary sources to illustrate points being made in the articles. And then the articles in each chapter compliment each other well. When I use a Major Problems text, I can always count on students commenting on the Primary sources, and understanding pretty well what the article authors are trying to convey.

God being spirit, the man who worships Him must worship in spirit and truth. It is therefore essential for man to be spiritual. This is what the gospel of Jesus Christ is all about. Salvation is the way to spirituality. The original three volume set of The Spiritual Man by Watchman Nee serves as a guide, not as a manual, to walk in spiritual life as well as to fight the spiritual warfare. It was written under tremendous spiritual conflict. Only through the grace of God and the victory of Christ was Watchman Nee able to finish the writing. Now having become a Christian classic, it may be considered as Watchman Nee&#39;s legacy to the Church. Condensed in this new volume, there are 42 lessons to be learned in journeying towards the spiritual. May we be guided by the Spirit of God to heartily learn these necessary lessons all to the glory of God.</p><p>Watchaman Nee se convirtio al cristianismo en China a la edad de diecisiete anos y comenzo a escribir en el mismo ano. A traves de casi treinta anos de ministerio se evidencio como un don unico del Senor para su iglesia en ese tiempo. En 1952 fue hecho prisionero por su fe y permanecio en prision hasta su muerte en 1972. Sus palabras permanecen como una fuente de abundante revelacion espiritual para los cristianos de todo el mundo.</p><h2>Worry Less, Live More: God&#x2019;s Prescription for a Better Life</h2><p><p><strong>How do you bury worry before it buries you?</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Worry, which is essentially a strain of fear, is a rational response to real pressures and problems. Life is harder than we expect, and even the Lord Jesus, the Prince of Peace Himself, admitted, &#x201c;Each day has enough trouble of its own&#x201d; (Matthew 6:34). He said, &#x201c;In this world you will have trouble&#x201d; (John 16:33). On one occasion, He even said, &#x201c;Now my soul is troubled, and what shall I say?&#x201d; (John 12:27). Our souls are easily troubled. The world and its trials seem to only increase.&nbsp;</p><p>In nearly forty years of pastoral counseling, Rob Morgan has seen a lot of changes in our culture. People are anxious, and everyone seems increasingly tense and taunt. We&#x2019;re overextended, running on empty, and often running late. We&#x2019;re worried and we&#x2019;re weary. One moment we&#x2019;re alarmed about global politics and the next we&#x2019;re frustrated with a clogged commode or a cranky boss. Stress can have a way of keeping us on pins and needles from dawn to darkness.</p><p>In this book Pastor Morgan leads the way through the investigation of the Bible&#x2019;s premier passage on the subject of anxiety. Philippians 4:4&#x2013;9 is God&#x2019;s most definitive word about overcoming anxiety and experiencing His overwhelming peace. Dissecting the following eight practices this vital passage promotes will help you to wage war on worry:</p><ul><li>The Practice of Rejoicing</li><li>The Practice of Gentleness</li><li>The Practice of Nearness</li><li>The Practice of Prayer</li><li>The Practice of Thanksgiving</li><li>The Practice of Thinking</li><li>The Practice of Discipleship</li><li>The Practice of Peace</li></ul><p>When we study and employ these practices effectively, we have the power to erase anxious thoughts and compose our minds with peace in any situation.</p></p><p><p>Robert J.

The past not only still has something to tell us, but it also has something that it <i>must</i> tell us. In this profound and wide-ranging historical survey, Michael Walsh illuminates the ways that the narrative and visual arts both reflect and affect the course of political history, outlining the way forward by arguing for the restoration of the Heroic Narrative that forms the basis of all Western cultural and religious traditions. Let us listen, then, to the angels of our nature, for better and worse. They have much to tell us, if only we will listen.</p><p>MICHAEL WALSH is a journalist, author, and screenwriter, whose work includes six novels, nine works of nonfiction, and a hit Disney movie. The former classical music critic and foreign correspondent for <i>Time</i> magazine, he is now a regular contributor of political and cultural commentary to PJ Media and American Greatness, as well as a Sunday op-ed columnist for the <i>New York Post.</i> His awards include the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award for distinguished music criticism in 1979, and the American Book Awards prize for fiction for his gangster novel, <i>And All the Saints</i>, in 2004.<br>&#x201c;For decades now, the cultural Left has been waging a war for our souls and freedoms, and their success depends on our increasing inability to comprehend and appreciate the rich spiritual and intellectual heritage of Western civilization. In <i>The Fiery Angel</i>, Michael Walsh's dazzling intellect is on full display and readers will walk away not just with a tremendous appreciation of the Judeo-Christian beliefs and heroic narratives that have preserved and protected us for thousands of years, but he also gives them the tools to go out and defend these ideals from the cultural onslaught.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;Mollie Hemingway, Senior Editor of <i>The Federalist</i> and Fox News contributor<br> &#x201c;From Aristotle to <i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>, Michael Walsh seeks light in these dark times in the deepest sources of our culture and its most illuminating works of art. From the divine to the erotic and from the contemplative to the heroic, it&#x2019;s all there, waiting, in <i>The Fiery Angel</i>.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> &#x2015;Kevin Williamson, author of <i>The End Is Near and It's Going To Be Awesome</i><br> &#x201c;This unique book teaches Western civilization and its agonists by acquainting the reader with the fundamentals of western art&#x2015;music, literature, and painting. Walsh reminds us that the arts are the basic means by which any and all peoples interpret the experiences of life. The arts are civilization&#x2019;s substance. Empires are epiphenomena. Shakespeare counts for more than Elizabeth I and Solzhenitsyn more than Brezhnev. Politicizing the arts destroys civilization, understanding them preserves it. Read this book. You will learn from it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;Angelo M. Codevilla, Professor Emeritus of International Relations at Boston University<br> &#x201c;In his magisterial defense of Western Civilization, Michael Walsh shows how the cultural Marxist Left&#x2019;s war against human nature, virtue, norms, and a nation&#x2019;s culture is actually a war against God&#x2019;s creation. It will ultimately be trumped by honest history and art that faithfully reflects the human condition&#x2015;our perennial struggle between the better and worse angels of our nature. Ultimately, when we seek beauty and reject Promethean ugliness, we will come closer to basing our society on goodness and truth&#x2015;and our civilization may even survive.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2015;Dr. John Lenczowski, Founder and President of The Institute of World Politics in Washington, D.C.</p><h2>Tamarisk Row</h2><p>First published in Australia in 1974, and like all his books unpublished in the UK until now, Tamarisk Row is Gerald Murnane&#39;s first novel, and in many respects his masterpiece, an unsparing evocation of a Catholic childhood in a country town in the late 1940s. Clement Killeaton transforms his surroundings into an imagined world centred on horse-racing, played out in the dusty backyard of his home, across the landscapes of the district, and the continent of Australia. Out of the child&#39;s boredom and fear and fascination, Murnane&#39;s lyrical prose opens perspectives charged with yearning and illumination, offering in the process a truly original view of mid-twentieth-century boyhood.</p><p></p><h2>Sweet Laurel Falls: A Clean &amp; Wholesome Romance (Hope's Crossing, 3)</h2><p><br><br>Spring should bring renewal, but Maura McKnight-Parker cannot escape the past.

This year, Maura McKnight-Parker wanted a vacation <em>from</em> Christmas. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she could just crawl into a warm cave somewhere and sleep through the holidays?<br><br>With a sigh, Maura took a final look around at the cozy nook where she had arranged several of the plump sofas and chairs normally scattered throughout her bookstore-slash-coffeehouse. Everything appeared ready for the Books and Bites book club Christmas party and gift exchange tonight.<br><br>Nibbles? Check. M&amp;M's, spiced nuts and popcorn mix waited in holiday-printed bowls, and she had even dragged out her Christmas china and coffee mugs for said nibbles.<br><br>Decorations? Check. Not much to do there, since the halls of Dog-Eared Books &amp; Brew had already been decked the week before Thanksgiving with artificial Christmas trees adorned in elegant blues and whites and silver. Snowflakes and gleaming ornaments in the same color scheme dangled from the ceiling, lightly dancing in the currents of air whenever anybody opened the front door.<br><br>Gifts? Yes. She had set up a little tabletop tree with handmade blown-glass ornaments for each of the book club members that she had commissioned from an artist with a gallery in town.<br><br>In addition to that pretty bit of swag, she had spent the past few days scouring shelves and boxes in her office and had filled gift bags for all the book club members, brimming with coffee and tea samples and some of the promotional bookmarks, notepads and other tchotchkes authors and their publicists were always sending to the store.<br><br>Despite a deep-seated wish that she could just hole up in her house for Christmas like a fox in a cozy den, she had worked tirelessly for days to make this party a success. If she were a scam artist, she would have called this baiting her trap. She had to convince her dearest friends and family members that she was indeed trying to move forward with her life after the hell of the past year. To accomplish that, she needed to put on a convincing show for them.<br><br>Maybe then, everybody would back off and give her a little space to find her own way.<br><br>"What do you think?" she asked April Herrera, who was taking a load of Books &amp; Brew coffee mugs out of the small dishwasher behind the counter.<br><br>The assistant manager for the coffeehouse side of her business gazed at the setup with an enchanted look in her eyes that seemed at odds with her henna-colored hair, pencil-thin eyebrows and various diamond studs.<br><br>The silk long-underwear shirt she wore underneath her barista shirt and apron hid the various tattoos Maura knew adorned her arms.<br><br>Judging only by appearances, April ought to be wild and cynical. Instead, she was just about the sweetest person Maura knew. More important, she was smart and hardworking and intuitive about her customers.<br><br>"It looks super in here. Just perfect. You guys are going to have <em>such</em> a great time."<br><br>Maura tended to have a soft spot for rebellious girls, probably because she'd been one in another lifetime. "Are you sure you can't stay?"<br><br>"I really wish I could. Your book club meetings are always a hoot. Your mom cracks me up every time she comes in, and it's hilarious to watch Ruth and Claire together. Do they <em>ever</em> agree on a book?"<br><br>"Rarely," she answered. Or anything else, for that matter. Ruth Tatum worked in the bookstore, and she and her daughter had what could best be described as a complicated relationship. "You should really stay. You know everyone would love to have you again. Your comments on the last book were really insightful."<br><br>"I can't. Sorry. I've really got to take off as soon as Josh gets here. This is my very first time night-skiing with the team."<br><br>"How's that going?" she asked.<br><br>"Excellent." The young woman's face lit up. "I think they're ready to put me on the schedule on a regular basis."<br><br>April was training for the ski patrol and also taking classes in hope of eventually becoming a paramedic. Maura didn't know how she juggled work and class and her two-year-old son, especially on her own. Maybe that was another reason she had taken April under her wing&#x2014;she could certainly relate to being a young single mother just trying to survive.<br><br>"That's terrific. If you need me to make any adjustments to your work schedule here, just say the word. I'm flexible. And I'm happy to babysit Trek whenever you need."<br><br>"Thanks, Maur."<br><br>"Maybe you can come to the book club meeting in January, if it fits around all the plates you have spinning."<br><br>"Definitely!" April started to add something else, but a customer at the coffee counter rang the little bell, and she gave Maura a "later" kind of wave and headed back to take the order.<br><br>Personally, Maura couldn't wait for January, to finally turn that page of her calendar to a new year. Maybe once the holiday craziness was over, she could escape some of the pressure of trying to act as if everything was fine when she was frozen solid inside.<br><br>She grabbed one more bowl of spicy nuts and set it on a side table, then moved a bowl of plump, airy peppermints to another spot. Having dear friends and family members surrounding her in Hope's Crossing was both a blessing and a curse. She knew they loved her and worried for her. While she understood their concern and tried to be grateful, mostly she just found it exhausting and overwhelming.<br><br>Sometimes that ever-present concern made her feel as if she had been buried alive under an avalanche. It pressed down on her, heavy and suffocating, until all she wanted to do was scramble for an air pocket.<br><br>Even her little bungalow on Mountain Laurel Road wouldn't remain a haven for long. In a few days, her daughter Sage would be coming home from college for the holidays, bringing yet another pair of watchful eyes.<br><br>She could do it. A few more weeks of pretending, and then she could have the cold nights of January to herself.<br><br>After one last look around, she suddenly remembered she'd meant to grab a couple extra copies of this month's book club selection off the shelf, in case anybody forgot theirs and needed it for reference. She had several copies in the display near the front, she remembered, and hurried in that direction.<br><br>A light snow drifted past the front display window, the big, fluffy flakes reflecting the colorful Christmas lights on storefronts up and down Main Street. Hope's Crossing was a true winter wonderland and local businesses worked hard to make the town glow with an old-fashioned, enticing charm. Nearly every store had some kind of light display. Hers were LED icicles that appeared to be dripping.<br><br>The effort seemed to be working. Her store bustled with customers and, judging by the pedestrian and vehicle traffic on a normally slow Thursday night, the other businesses on Main Street were enjoying the same success.<br><br>An SUV snagged the last parking space in front of the cafe across the street and a few stores down from her. A man in a leather jacket and Levi's climbed out and snowflakes immediately landed on his wavy dark hair and the shoulders of his warm cocoa-colored coat. He looked sharp and put together.<br><br>Everyone would be arriving any second now and she should go put the finishing touches on the scene she had created, but for some reason she was drawn to the man she could still barely see.<br><br>Some indefinable aspect of him&#x2014;the angle of his jaw or the way he moved&#x2014;called to mind the image of her first love. Jackson Lange, sexy and dangerous, young, angry, ferociously smart.<br><br>She rarely thought about Jack anymore, except on the rare occasions when his unpleasant father came into the store. Why she would be wasting time wondering about him now when she had so much to do was a mystery.<br><br>The man walked around the other side of the vehicle to let someone out of the passenger side, a gesture she didn't see enough these days. She was curious to see his companion, but before she could catch a glimpse of the woman, the front door of the shop opened and Claire and Evie burst through, bringing the scent of snow and Christmas. Their mingled laughter chimed more sweetly than carols.<br><br>"I know," Claire said. "That's what I told him. But this is his first Christmas as a stepfather, and I swear, he's more excited than Owen or Macy. I've had to hide the present stash a half-dozen times, and he finds every blasted spot."<br><br>"What do you expect, honey?" Evie untwisted her scarf, hand-knitted in a heathery wool that dangled with beads instead of fringe. "He's a trained detective. It's kind of what he does."<br><br>The two of them had probably walked over from the bead store Claire owned, just down the street a block. Evie rented an apartment upstairs from Claire. For now, anyway. Evie was dating Brodie Thorne, her friend Katherine's son, and Maura expected their relationship was progressing quickly.<br><br>Claire's soft, pretty features lit up when she saw her. "Maura, honey, the store looks fabulous. I keep meaning to tell you every day when I come in for coffee, but you're never standing still long enough."<br><br>"Your mom did a lot of the work. It was her idea to hang all the snowflakes and the ornaments. Isn't that brilliant?"<br><br>Ruth had been working at the bookstore for months, but Claire still seemed baffled by it. Maura couldn't blame her. No one was more surprised than Maura when Ruth's offer to help out temporarily during those dark days and weeks in the spring had turned into a permanent arrangement that had worked out beautifully for everyone concerned.<br><br>"Ruth is a great employee," she assured Claire again. "Hardworking and dependable, with these wonderful, unexpected flashes of ingenuity, like the snowflakes."<br><br>"And here she is now," Evie announced.<br><br>Sure enough, a moment later Ruth walked in, along with Maura's mother, Mary Ella, and Katherine Thorne. With them was Janie Hamilton, a fairly new addition to town and another lost lamb Katherine had taken under her wing, and right behind them was Charlotte Caine, who owned the candy store in town.<br><br>Maura took a deep breath and put on her game face, that forced smile that had become second nature since her world had changed forever eight months earlier. "Welcome, everyone. I'm so happy you can all come."<br><br>She stepped forward to hug and brush cheeks with everyone as they all began to shed coats and scarves and hats like penguins molting in the spring. Everyone seemed to have on holiday party clothes: shimmery blouses, festive patterned scarves, dangling earrings and beaded necklaces.<br><br>She felt drab in her suede jacket, tailored cream shirt and jeans, though she was wearing one of her favorite chunky wood-bead necklaces she had made at String Fever last year.<br><br>"What about Alex?" she asked. "Isn't she coming?"<br><br>"Angie's picking her up," her mother assured her. "They texted me a few minutes ago to tell me they're running late. As usual."<br><br>"Whew. That's a relief. She's supposed to be bringing dessert, those delicious pumpkin spice cupcakes she makes."<br><br>"The ones with the cinnamon buttermilk icing? Oh, yay!" Claire said. "I guess since I'm not trying to fit into a wedding dress anymore, I might be able to let myself have one."<br><br>Maura could probably afford to eat five or six, since all her clothes fit her loosely now. Amazing how little appetite she had these days. "Everybody grab coffee or tea or whatever you're drinking from the counter. I've got us set up in the corner."<br><br>She ushered everyone over to the coffee counter in time to see April hang her apron on the hook. Josh Kimball had come in to replace her for the evening shift. He waved and grinned his charmer of a grin at her, and she managed to dredge up a small smile for his perpetual raccoon eyes, white in an otherwise bronzed face where his goggles blocked the sun while he was snowboarding.<br><br>"I'm off. I'll see you later," April said as she grabbed her coat.<br><br>"Thank you for everything. Good luck with the night patrol. See you tomorrow."<br><br>"You got it." April swung open the door just as a couple walked in&#x2014;and suddenly all the air whooshed out of Maura's lungs.<br><br>It was the man she had seen a half hour earlier entering the cafe, the same impractical leather jacket, the same wavy dark hair, the same plaid scarf.<br><br>In the hanging track lights of her store, she could clearly see her mistake.<br><br>This man didn't simply bear a mild, passing resemblance to Jackson Lange.<br><br>He most definitely <em>was</em> Jackson Lange.<br><br>For one crazy second, her mind became a tangle of half-buried memories, the kind that came from being young and impulsive and passionately in love. The first time he held her hand in a darkened theater, shared confidences on a sun-warmed boulder high up the canyon, tangled bodies and mouths, the peace she found only with him&#x2014;then the vast heartache and the sharp, gnawing fear after he left.<br><br>Someone was talking to her. Evie, she thought vaguely, but the words couldn't register past her dismayed shock.<br><br>Jack had vowed never to step foot in Hope's Crossing, with the fierce, unwavering determination only an eighteen-year-old young man could claim.<br><br>Yet here he was.<br><br>Yeah. Like she needed one more thing to make this Christmas really suck. This was definitely the cherry on top of the fruitcake&#x2014;for Jackson Lange to come into her store with his undoubtedly lovely wife to have a cappuccino or maybe browse through one of the nonfiction sections. Travel, maybe, or her small but adequate architectural design shelf.<br><br>And in the middle of her book club meeting, for crying out loud.<br><br>She could just ignore him. If she ducked behind a bookcase, with luck, he wouldn't see her. He probably had no idea she owned Dog-Eared Books &amp; Brew&#x2014;why would he possibly know that? She could send one of the clerks over to escort him to the farthest corner away from the book club&#x2014;or better yet, have Josh come with all his delightful snowboarder muscles and throw him out in the cold. She'd never heard of a bookstore having a bouncer, but there was always a first time.<br><br>Too late. He turned just at that moment and his blue-eyed gaze met hers. She saw definite recognition there. Oddly, he didn't seem at all surprised to see her, almost as if he had come looking for her. That was impossible, of course. In nearly twenty years, he hadn't made the smallest effort to find her. Not that it would have taken much work on his part. She hadn't gone anywhere.<br><br>The years had been unfairly kind to him, she saw, had taken a teenage boy who had been brooding and angry and undeniably gorgeous to all the other teenage girls and turned him into a sexy, potent male, with intense blue eyes, a firm mouth and the resolute jaw-line that just might be the only thing he shared with his father.<br><br>"Are you all right?"<br><br>She managed to look away and saw her mother studying her with concern. "What?"<br><br>"You've gone pale, darling. And I asked you three times if you made these delicious truffles. What's the matter?"<br><br></p><h2>3 Crucial Questions about Spiritual Warfare (Three Crucial Questions)</h2><p>Knowledgeable, accessible answers to these provocative questions: What is spiritual warfare? Can a Christian be demonpossessed? Are we called to engage territorial spirits?</p><p>What is spiritual warfare? Can a Christian be demon-possessed? Are we called to engage territorial spirits? These provocative questions stand at the heart of evangelical discussions of the demonic. Bringing his expository skill and extensive knowledge of early Christianity to bear on the contemporary understanding of the spiritual realm, Clinton Arnold develops a biblical understanding of spiritual warfare, defines the influence demons can have on believers, and sheds invaluable light on the controversial topic of territorial spirits and the extent of believers&#39; authority over them.<b>Clinton E. Arnold</b>, professor of New Testament language and literature at Talbot School of Theology, is a noted authority on spiritual warfare.

On 28 August 1815, the US brig Commerce was dashed against Mauritania&#39;s Cape Bojador and lost, although through bravery and quick thinking the ship&#39;s captain, James Riley, managed to lead all of his crew to safety. What followed was an extraordinary and desperate battle for survival in the face of human hostility, hunger, dehydration and despair, as the crew were captured, robbed and enslaved. They were reduced to drinking urine (their own and the camels&#39;), flayed by the sun, crippled by walking miles across burning stones and sand. And, over time, James Riley and Sidi Hamet, slave and captor, came to recognize in each other men worthy of respect and the ransom not only of Riley himself but also of a handful of his crew suddenly seemed possible. But, Sidi Hamet had enemies of his own, and to reach safety the sailors had to overcome not only the desert but also the greed and anger of those who would keep them in captivity.</p><p>Some stories are so enthralling they deserve to be retold generation after generation. The wreck in 1815 of the Connecticut merchant ship, <i>Commerce</i>, and the subsequent ordeal of its crew in the Sahara Desert, is one such story. With <i>Skeletons on the Zahara: A True Story of Survival</i>, Dean King refreshes the popular nineteenth-century narrative once read and admired by Henry David Thoreau, James Fenimore Cooper, and Abraham Lincoln. King&#x2019;s version, which actually draws from two separate first person accounts of the <i>Commerce</i>'s crew, offers a page-turning blend of science, history, and classic adventure. The book begins with a seeming false start: tracing the lives of two merchants from North Africa, Seid and Sidi Hamet, who lose their fortunes&#x2014;and almost their lives&#x2014;when their massive camel caravan arrives at a desiccated oasis. King then jumps to the voyage of the <i>Commerce</i> under Captain Riley and his 11-man crew. After stops in New Orleans and Gibraltar, the ship falls off course en route to the Canary Islands and ultimately wrecks at the infamous Cape Bojador. After the men survive the first predations of the nomads on the shore, they meander along the coast looking for a way inland as their supplies dwindle. They subsist for days by drinking their own urine. Eventually, to their horror, they discover that they have come aground on the edge of the Sahara Desert. They submit themselves, with hopes of getting food and water, as slaves to the Oulad Bou Sbaa. After days of abuse, they are bought by Hamet, who, after his own experiences with his failed caravan (described at the novels opening), sympathizes with the plight of the crew. Together, they set off on a hellish journey across the desert to collect a bounty for Hamet in Swearah. King embellishes this compelling narrative throughout with scientific and historical material explaining the origins of the camel, the market for English and American slaves, and the stages of dehydration. He also humanizes the Sahrawi with background on the tribes and on the lives of Hamet and Seid.

While gazing at Rauschenberg's painting <i>Double Feature,</i> Tomkins felt compelled to make some kind of literal connection to the work, and it is in that sprit that "for the last forty years it's been [his] ambition to write about contemporary art not as a critic or a judge, but as a participant." Tomkins has spent many of those years writing about Robert Rauschenberg, whom he rapidly came to see as "one of the most inventive and influential artists of his generation." So it seemed natural to make Rauschenberg the focus of <i>Off the Wall</i>, which deals with the radical changes that have made advanced visual art such a powerful force in the world.</p><p><i>Off the Wall</i> chronicles the astonishingly creative period of the 1950s and 1960s, a high point in American art. In his in his collaborations with Merce Cunningham and John Cage, and as a pivotal figure linking abstract expressionism and pop art, Rauschenberg was part of a revolution during which artists moved art off the walls of museums and galleries and into the center of the social scene. Rauschenberg's vitally important and productive career spans this revolution, reaching beyond it to the present day. Featuring the artists and the art world surrounding Rauschenberg--from Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning to Jasper Johns, Frank Stella, and Andy Warhol, together with dealers Betty Parsons, and Leo Castelli, and the patron Peggy Guggenheim--Tomkins's stylish and witty portrait of one of America's most original and inspiring artists is fascinating, enlightening, and very entertaining.</p></p><p><p><b>Calvin Tomkins</b>, a staff writer for <i>The New Yorker</i> since 1960, has written more than a dozen books, including the bestseller <i>Living Well Is the Best Revenge</i>, <i>Merchants and Masterpieces: The Story of the Metropolitan Museum of Art</i>, <i>The Bride and the Bachelors,</i> and his highly acclaimed biography <i>Duchamp. </i>He lives in New York city with his wife Dodie Kazanjian.</p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong><br><br>Venice, 1964<br><br>More than once during the chaotic week before the opening, Alan Solomon, the United States Commissioner for the 1964 Venice Biennale, had the distinct impression that too many people were trying in too many languages to tell him what to do. Some of them, like Alice Denney, his outspoken Vice-Commissioner, thought he was being too aggressive, too demanding. Leo Castelli seemed to think he was not being aggressive enough. Castelli&#x2019;s New York gallery represented both Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, which gave him a certain leverage. All the same it was annoying for Solomon to hear the rumors that Castelli was really running the American show at the Biennale this time, with the canny assistance of his ex-wife, the Paris dealer Ileana Sonnabend, a mano fina if ever there was one. The worst of it was that Rauschenberg, a strong contender for the Biennale&#x2019;s grand international prize in painting (a prize no American artist had yet won), was suddenly in danger of being disqualified through a series of mistakes that could be attributed to his, Solomon&#x2019;s, inexperience, or his aggressiveness, or both.<br><br>The problem was that only one of the twenty-two Rauschenberg works on exhibition was hanging in the official United States pavilion at the Biennale; the rest were installed in the former United States Consulate on the Grand Canal. Solomon thought this had all been worked out months before.1 The U.S. pavilion was a joke, an imitation-Georgian house with ridiculously oversized columns and hardly any space inside. Americans who visited the Biennale, the oldest and most prestigious of the great European art fairs, were nearly always surprised and chagrined to find that the U.S. pavilion was so much smaller than those of France, Britain, Germany, or even the Scandinavian countries. It had been erected in 1929 by the Grand Central Art Galleries, a private New York art firm that sponsored American participation in the Biennale until the Museum of Modern Art took over that function in 1948. When the museum dropped its sponsorship in 1962, pleading inadequate funds, the federal government stepped in at long last (all the other national exhibitions are government-sponsored), and entrusted the responsibility to the United States Information Agency, whose director at the time happened to be Edward R. Murrow. Instead of simply shouldering the financial end and asking the Museum of Modern Art to continue putting together exhibitions every two years, as had been anticipated, the USIA made inquiries around the art world and then offered the job of assembling the 1964 exhibition to Solomon, a gifted art scholar who had proved, during his previous year as director of the Jewish Museum in New York, to have a genius for installation and a lively sympathy for the latest currents in American art. (His opening show at the Jewish Museum was a major Rauschenberg retrospective, which helped to establish that artist as a hero to the younger generation; in 1964 he would devote an equally influential show to Johns.) Solomon asked for and was promised an entirely free hand in putting together the exhibition, and, pleased by the competence of the USIA people he talked with and by what he considered the new cultural tone of the Kennedy administration, he accepted the job.<br><br>There was some talk at this time (1963) of enlarging the American pavilion in Venice. The architect Philip Johnson had volunteered to design the addition free of charge, and the USIA had expressed interest. John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination, which happened while Solomon was on his way to Venice that fall to make preliminary arrangements, put an end to this plan; appropriations would be held up indefinitely during the transition period in Washington, and with only six months left until the Biennale opening, there would not be enough time to do anything. Shaken by the news from Dallas, uncertain whether to proceed with his mission or just turn around and go home, Solomon arrived in Venice and met the Biennale officials. He went out to the Giardini, the green park toward the Lido end of the island that serves as a permanent exhibition area, and inspected the United States pavilion. It struck him as hopelessly inadequate for the kind of exhibition he had in mind. Solomon had heard that other countries were sometimes given extra space to exhibit in the large Italian pavilion, but when he asked about this he was told that too many such requests had already been made. He then inquired whether it would be all right to show some of the American work in a building outside the Biennale grounds. This was a possibility, he was told. After looking at several spaces, Solomon was shown the former United States Consulate, directly across the Grand Canal from the Gritti Palace Hotel and adjoining the squat, rather ugly palazzo of Peggy Guggenheim. Officially closed a month earlier&amp;mdash-one of a series of such closings in a State Department economy drive&amp;mdash-the building still belonged to the U.S. Government, and its cool, graceful salons seemed made to order for exhibition purposes. After receiving from the president of the Biennale, Professor Mario Marcazzan, what he took to be adequate assurances that any paintings hanging there would be part of the official U.S. exhibit, he carefully measured the downstairs rooms and flew back to New York to start planning his show.<br><br>His plans, as they evolved, were characteristically ambitious. Solomon wanted to put on an exhibition that would wake the Europeans up to what American art had become in the last ten years&amp;mdash-that would do for Europe, in a sense, what the 1913 Armory Show had done for America. Since the first, pioneer generation of New York Abstract Expressionists had already received some exposure at previous Biennales&amp;mdash-Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and others in a group show in 1950; a one-man de Kooning show in 1952&amp;mdash-Solomon decided to focus on the two major developments since Abstract Expressionism, as he saw them: the pure chromatic abstraction of Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland, and the highly complex paintings and assemblages of Rauschenberg and Johns, in which Abstract Expressionist techniques were brought to bear on subject matter taken straight from everyday life. In addition to these four germinal artists, Solomon was including the work of four younger men: Claes Oldenburg, Jim Dine, Frank Stella, and John Chamberlain.<br><br>In Europe, at least, Rauschenberg was already known. Still something of a b�te noire in America, where his more outrageous constructions incorporating such flotsam as a stuffed chicken, a goat with a tire around its middle, and the artist&#x2019;s own quilt used as a canvas, were considered rather bad jokes by the older generation of Abstract Expressionists as well as by most art critics, the youthful, Texas-born artist recently had excited considerable attention in Paris, where Ileana Sonnabend had given him two shows in 1963, and also in London, where his retrospective exhibition at the White-chapel Gallery the preceding February had broken all attendance records, and had led the <em>Sunday Telegraph</em>&#x2019;s critic to call him the most important American artist since Jackson Pollock. Rauschenberg&#x2019;s rapidly escalating reputation in Europe, among other factors, had helped Solomon decide that he could become the first American painter to win the Biennale.<br><br>The system of prize-giving at the Biennale traditionally gave rise to intense political in-fighting among the nations.* There were two major international awards, one of which usually went to a painter and the other to a sculptor (in 1964, each included a payment of $3,200). The City of Venice also gave prizes to outstanding Italian artists, and there were a number of other awards as well, but the two international prizes were the important ones, and only one American artist had ever taken one of those&amp;mdash-Alexander Calder, for sculpture, in 1952. In fact, the only two Americans to win painting prizes of any kind at the Venice Biennale had been Mark Tobey in 1958 and James Abbott McNeill Whistler in 1895, the year the Biennale was inaugurated. Since the Second World War, the grand prize for painting had gone almost without exception to School of Paris artists with long-established reputations: Georges Braque in 1948, Henri Matisse in 1950, Raoul Dufy in 1952 (the year America was represented by de Kooning), Max Ernst in 1954, Jacques Villon in 1956, Jean Fautrier and Hans Hartung in 1960 (no sculpture prize that year), and Alfred Manessier in 1962. The spectacular rise of the New York School, which since the late forties had produced the strongest body of painting in contemporary art, which had helped to make New York the new capital of the international art world, and whose influence was now so widespread that a great many of the paintings on view at the 1964 Biennale, in pavilion after pavilion, looked like weak imitations of Pollock or de Kooning&amp;mdash-all this had not received as yet the slightest notice from the juries of the Biennale.<br><br>The opportunity to change this situation was at hand, Solomon felt, except that part of the jury wanted to disqualify Rauschenberg because his work was not hanging on the Biennale grounds. Solomon had assembled a small Rauschenberg retrospective&amp;mdash-twenty-two paintings and assemblages&amp;mdash-and installed it magnificently in the Consulate, together with paintings by Johns, Stella, and Dine and sculptures by Oldenburg and Chamberlain. Noland&#x2019;s targets and chevron paintings and Louis&#x2019;s poured veils of color were hanging in the pavilion in the Giardini. Nearly everyone agreed that Solomon had done a brilliant job of installation, but now Professor Marcazzan was insisting that when he had told Solomon it would be all right to exhibit works outside the Biennale grounds, he had not meant to imply that such works would be eligible for prizes.<br><br>Marcazzan&#x2019;s duties included the selection of the seven Biennale judges, an exercise in finesse that was supposed to leave no nation feeling that its vital interes...</p></p><h2>Ulysses S. Grant: The American Presidents Series: The 18th President, 1869-1877</h2><p><p><b>The underappreciated presidency of the military man who won the Civil War and then had to win the peace as well</b></p><p>As a general, Ulysses S. Grant is routinely described in glowing terms-the man who turned the tide of the Civil War, who accepted Lee's surrender at Appomattox, and who had the stomach to see the war through to final victory. But his presidency is another matter-the most common word used to characterize it is "scandal." Grant is routinely portrayed as a man out of his depth, whose trusting nature and hands-off management style opened the federal coffers to unprecedented plunder. But that caricature does not do justice to the realities of Grant's term in office, as Josiah Bunting III shows in this provocative assessment of our eighteenth president.</p><p>Grant came to Washington in 1869 to lead a capital and a country still bitterly divided by four years of civil war. His predecessor, Andrew Johnson, had been impeached and nearly driven from office, and the radical Republicans in Congress were intent on imposing harsh conditions on the Southern states before allowing them back into the Union. Grant made it his priority to forge the states into a single nation, and Bunting shows that despite the troubles that characterized Grant's terms in office, he was able to accomplish this most important task-very often through the skillful use of his own popularity with the American people. Grant was indeed a military man of the highest order, and he was a better president than he is often given credit for.</p></p><p><p>A Rhodes Scholar and a decorated army officer, <i>J</i><b>osiah Bunting III </b>served in Vietnam and was superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute for eight years.

Bunting is also a classical pianist and a long-distance runner. He lives in Newport, Rhode Island.</p>Ulysses S. Grant<br>1A Son of the WestFor most of his life Ulysses S. Grant thought of himself as a westerner. He was a child of the great Valley of Democracy, born on April 27, 1822, a hundred yards from the north bank of the Ohio. The country thereabouts was less than a generation removed from raw frontier, Ohio having achieved statehood only nineteen years earlier, and the village of Point Pleasant, some twenty-five miles southeast of Cincinnati, was but a tiny huddle of cabins and rude frame houses. Ohio was the easternmost of the states being carved from the old Northwest Territory, but to New England and New York, to the original states of the Atlantic seaboard, it seemed still a remote West: raw and bountiful, unfettered, rich in possibility.Forty years later, in 1862, it was as a western general that Grant achieved the sudden celebrity that seems peculiarly American, after his victory and successful demand for an unconditional surrender at Fort Donelson--a Union triumph that thrilled the country and resuscitated its hopes and confidence; and, just two years after that, it was as the famous leader of the western armies that he was selected to command all Union forces. He was "brought east." The small vignette of Grant's arrival in the grand lobby of Willard's Hotel in Washington, in March 1864, is an enduring cameo of American popular history: the most famous man in the country, next to Abraham Lincoln himself, signing the register as "U.S. Grantand son, Galena, Ill.," a traveler so small and dusty that the clerk did not recognize him; an unpretentious guest who could not, it appeared, have cared less. No doubt, too, the instinctive rapport between Abraham Lincoln and his new lieutenant general owed much to their common heritage as westerners--as James Russell Lowell said of Lincoln, "out of the very earth, unancestried, unprivileged, unknown"--and was demonstrated most powerfully in their common understanding of the needs of the South in the days just before, and just after, Appomattox.Grant, it is true, was "ancestried" in a way that Lincoln was not. It was known that Matthew Grant had landed in Massachusetts Bay in 1630. But Grant's paternal forebears had been moving west for two centuries: from Plymouth, Massachusetts, to the Connecticut River valley, across New York State and Pennsylvania. Ulysses Grant's grandfather, Captain Noah Grant, had fought in the Revolution, lost his first wife, remarried, and moved to western Pennsylvania. Here he and Rachel built a cabin on the Monongahela River, not far from modern Pittsburgh. They raised a large family. Noah, by trade a cobbler and by character an idler, would soon move the family again: first to Fawcettstown, Ohio, on the Ohio River, thence to Deerfield in the Western Reserve.There is a homely story--such tales cannot be authenticated--that Noah's son Jesse, the father of Ulysses Grant, just shy of his sixth birthday, came upon his mother, who was alone and weeping. "George Washington is dead," Rachel told her son. "Is he any relation of yours?" the boy asked. This was in December 1799.Rachel died only three years later, and, in the unhappy practice of the time, the family was eventually broken up, the younger children distributed among relatives, and the eldest, Jesse included, put out to make their way on their own. Jesse was eleven.He made his way by mother wit and determination. In adolescence Jesse's was already an avid, ambitious personality, close to the caricature of frontier Americans already familiar to English and European visitors and readers. A modern student of the Ohio of this time notes that Americans were "fidgety and nervous when not doing something that might be called work." Jesse did odd jobs, wasa roustabout for three years until, by serendipity, he was hired by Judge and Mrs. George Tod to work on their farm near Youngstown. It was the making of him. He lived with the Tods for five years, growing into a young man of Gatsbyan ambition. The Tods lived comfortably and well; they read, they had nice things; they challenged, worked, educated, and inspired him. Jesse developed an unassuageable determination to become rich, to be Somebody. He read voraciously; he became a lifelong autodidact, a man of words and opinions of whom it might be said that "he never had an unuttered thought." But the boy of six who wondered whether his mother was related to George Washington would survive to see his own son twice inaugurated as president: and, at one of those inaugurals, compared to Washington himself.Jesse moved on. He learned and worked at the tanner's trade under his half brother Peter, in Maysville, Kentucky; later with an Ohio tanner, Owen Brown, and his son (Jesse's contemporary), the future abolitionist John Brown; finally as the young partner of another Ohioan, in Ravenna, John Wells. <i>Tanning</i> to contemporary ears connotes little; it is no more helpful to our sense of its contemporary importance and standing as the fact that Saint Paul's father was a tent maker. Tanning was in fact an enormously lucrative trade in the first half of the nineteenth century. The demand for leather and worked leather goods was huge. This was a business in which, by the standards of rural Ohio, an ambitious, smart man could grow rich. The famous Galena address (<i>U.S. Grant, Galena, Ill</i>.) owes entirely to Jesse's success as a tanner whose business eventually expanded from southern Ohio to northwestern Illinois.Jesse Grant was now twenty-three. Four years later, in June 1821, he married Hannah Simpson, the third of four children of another widower, John Simpson of Pennsylvania, who, like Captain Noah Grant, had remarried, moved west, lighting finally in Bethel, near Point Pleasant. Here he bought and worked a substantial farm, and here Jesse began his brief courtship of Hannah.She is variously described as calm, imperturbable, taciturn, "cleanly," quietly devout in her Methodism--a natural complement to her garrulous husband. It is fair to say that in temperament andpersonality, in what psychiatrists call affect, Ulysses became far more his mother's than his father's son.Hannah and Jesse would have six children, three girls and three boys, but Ulysses--the first--remained the apple of his father's eye for the first thirty years of his life, and, after a gap of several years, thereafter. He served partly as an engine of his father's ambition. Christened Hiram Ulysses (an uneasy burden at best, the "Ulysses" contracted to "Useless" during his boyhood), the son was raised in an atmosphere of easy discipline and devoted attention. Jesse always introduced or spoke of him as "my Ulysses." He doted on him. He communicated both to his son and to the town of Georgetown, the county seat to which the family moved in 1823, that he was, indeed, a child of singular gifts and destiny. The boy would succeed as Jesse was succeeding; he would be, he had to be, noticed and admired. Historians and biographers have imputed a variety of qualities of adult character to the nature of Ulysses Grant's boyhood, but their speculations often seem forced. What is known is that Jesse, a self-important bustler in a small town, bragged about Ulysses at every opportunity and was determined that he have every advantage. For her part, Hannah disbelieved in praise. She was undemonstrative in her affections; she was not a mother to whom the son could repair for understanding and compassionate counsel.Grant's boyhood was conventional for its time, punctuated by those kinds of events and experiences that childhood friends remember much later on, when their subject has become famous. He was taught at the local subscription school; in adolescence he was sent off for one-year terms at two nearby boarding schools, the latter to prepare him for possible attendance at West Point. He was an unremarkable student: diffident and inward, watchful, reluctant to speak up. The town saw him as bashful, inferring that, because he did not talk much, he wasn't particularly bright.He was drawn to experiences and work that challenged his practical ingenuity, such as contriving means of moving heavy rocks or logs needed for Jesse's tanning business (which the boy hated and which, no doubt, planted in him a lifetime's revulsion for the sights and smells of slaughter and blood). He evinced an early practicalhandiness--skill for doing, usually alone, practical things that needed to be done, taking particular pleasure in persevering until they were completed. It is not too much to argue that that quality in Grant which Lincoln most admired, and for which he was most constantly appreciative, was already visible in the boy of ten or twelve: that of not asking for help or advice, not freighting problems with imagined difficulties, but just doing them. Forty years on, when General George B. McClellan was demanding and pleading for more soldiers, Grant was asking simply, when do I start? "What I want is to advance."His own <i>Memoirs</i> provide testimony both ironic and genial.One of my superstitions has always been when I started to go anywhere, or to do anything, not to have to turn back until the thing intended was accomplished. I have frequently started to go places where I had never been to and to which I did not know the way, depending upon making inquiries on the road. And if I got past the place without knowing it, instead of turning back, I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction, take that, and come in on the other side.Grant evinced an early love for horses that was as powerful as his revulsion from the smells and sights of the tannery. There are several recorded memories of prodigies of horsemanship and of a rare and visible ability--what today might be called horse whispering--to communicate with them. By fourteen Ulysses had established a livery service, owned and operated alone, in which the young driver would deliver passengers all over Ohio. Earlier--an incident at the very epicenter of Grant lore, adduced as an example of the boy's dullness and credulity--Ulysses had visited a Mr. Ralston to buy a horse he wanted. Jesse had authorized him to go as high as twenty-five dollars, but to try to get the animal for twenty. "Papa says I can go as high as twenty-five," the boy said to the owner, who promptly sold him the horse for twenty-five dollars. Grant historiography has generally been unkind to the child, locating flaws which will bloomgrossly in later, political, life. But the anecdote may also illustrate other qualities: bottom-line directness and fairness. Grant knew the horse's worth. Nonetheless, the story achieved a wide contemporary currency, generally parsed by resentful neighbors as an example of stupidity. It is one of a small family of such tales; together they limn a portrait of a shy youngster sometimes slow on the uptake, driven in each successive encounter more and more upon his own resources, slowly becoming reluctant to say anything, to disclose to any but his closest companions his feelings and thoughts. Perhaps, as Churchill noted of his own ancestor Marlborough, such slights and twinges of adversity in youth are needed to "evoke that ruthless fixity of purpose and tenacious motherwit without which great purposes are seldom accomplished."Several Brown County boys had already attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, and one of them, Bartlett Bailey, had attended and failed. A vacancy was thus created. Jesse applied on Ulysses's behalf, seeking the nomination from Congressman Thomas L. Hamer, a former friend whom politics had estranged--Jesse was a Whig, Hamer a Jacksonian Democrat. Hamer now obliged Jesse, in a hurried final act of the spring 1839 congressional session, sending forward the name (so he imagined it to be) "Ulysses Simpson Grant."The son knew what was coming. Over the previous Christmas holiday Jesse had told him, "Ulysses, I believe you are going to receive your appointment.""What appointment?""To West Point. I have applied for it.""But I won't go."In his <i>Memoirs,</i> Ulysses recalled, "He said he thought I would, and I thought so too, if he did."Had there been an A. N. Wyeth or a Norman Rockwell in 1839, he would surely have been drawn to the scene: the youth, tiny, barely five feet tall, as apprehensive as eager, standing at the end of the dock on the shore of the gleaming broad river, entering upon an adventure that must have seemed cosmic in its dimension. No ardent patriotism or military vocation had brought Ulysses Grantto this pass. His was an opportunity unsought, an obligation laid upon him by a father with whom it would never have occurred to him to argue. The boy was game; he was curious; he seemed marked already by an easy fatalism that predisposed him to make the best of what he had been given, without complaint or undue worry. These qualities had already placed him at the observant edge of things: he was a watcher, slow in passing judgment, comfortable in going his own way, already full of the quiet self-reliance that made him act rather than explain himself. Neighbors and, much later, historians might smile at his horse whisperings, at the homely anecdotes retrofitted to make him look simple. It was widely expected that he would fail at West Point.All his life, and in the 120 years since his death, friends, rivals and enemies, biographers, and historians have condescended to Ulysses Grant. At seventeen he already understood that he produced such an effect on smart people. Not for the last time, he struck out on his own.Copyright � 2004 by Josiah Bunting III All rights reserved.</p><h2>On Sunset Beach: The Chesapeake Diaries</h2><p><b><i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>&nbsp;BESTSELLER �&nbsp;From&nbsp;Mariah Stewart comes a captivating and heartwarming novel in her beloved Chesapeake Diaries contemporary romance series&#x2014;perfect for fans of Barbara Freethy, Robyn Carr, and Susan Mallery.</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Carly Summit&#x2019;s name couldn&#x2019;t be more fitting, since in life she always lands on top.

Starting with pastels, Carolina moved on to charcoal (which she&#x2019;d pronounced &#x201c;too moody&#x201d;), then to watercolor, to oils, then back to watercolor again, where, her journal proclaimed, she&#x2019;d found her best, most expressive self.

And Carly&#x2019;s parents&#x2014;-there was no way she&#x2019;d be able to keep such momentous news from them, but she&#x2019;d sworn them to secrecy. But no one else knew about the extraordinary find Carly had made while visiting the house Ellie inherited from her mother in St.&nbsp;Dennis, Maryland. There, Carolina had met and married James Ryder, raised their two children, John and Lilly, and scandalously defied her husband&#x2019;s wishes by setting up an artist&#x2019;s studio on the third floor of their home on the Chesapeake Bay, where she spent part of every day working at her easel.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Carly rested her elbows on the desk and continued reading.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Amazing,&#x201d; she muttered as she read on. &#x201c;That this woman was able to produce such works while under this sort of domestic strain&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She reached for the phone somewhat absently when it rang.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; she said.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s how you answer your phone now?&#x201d; a familiar voice teased. &#x201c; &#x2018;Yes?&#x2019; &#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Mom. Hi. Sorry. I was deep into one of Carolina&#x2019;s journals that just arrived this afternoon. Ellie found a box in the attic that held a few more and she sent them to me. My head is absolutely spinning.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Lots of fodder for your book, I imagine.&#x201d; Roberta Summit was almost as fascinated by the Carolina Ellis story as her daughter. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait for you to finish Carolina&#x2019;s biography. Remember, you did promise that I could be your beta--reader.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Yes, but I need you to be brutally honest.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Not to worry. What kind of an editor would I be if I only told you what I thought you wanted to hear?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Carly paused momentarily. Should she tell her mother that she&#x2019;d hired a professional editor for her book, one who was already hard at work on the first half of the manuscript? Perhaps not. Roberta was so pleased at the opportunity to be helpful, to contribute to her daughter&#x2019;s work. Carly decided to keep that fact to herself.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I can email you the first half and you can let me know what you think of it so far, if you like.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Yes. Please. I can&#x2019;t wait to read it.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Carly opened her computer and attached the file to an email, which she addressed to her mother.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s on its way, Mom. I want this book to be fabulous and to generate a ton of interest in Carolina so that when I open my exhibit, people will stand in line for the opportunity to see her work.&#x201d; Carly straightened her spine to get the kinks out, then walked to the window. Outside all was dark. When, she wondered, had day turned to evening?<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;The art world will be turned on its head when you announce what you&#x2019;ve found. These paintings will create an absolutely deafening roar,&#x201d; Roberta assured her. &#x201c;After all, no one has any idea that these works even exist.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Every time I think about that, my brain threatens to explode. I can barely sit still long enough to write sometimes.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I can only imagine what it&#x2019;s like to have made a find like this, and to have it all to yourself. Bless Ellie for trusting you enough to turn the entire project over to you, no strings. Of course, you were a good friend to her throughout all her troubles.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been best friends since sixth grade,&#x201d; Carly reminded her mother. &#x201c;The fact that her father was a crook is no reflection on her.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I absolutely agree, and you know we love Ellie. But the fact of the matter is that you stood by her when everyone else she knew walked away.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what best friends do. Ellie&#x2019;s at a very happy place in her life right now. Engaged to Cameron, living in that wonderful old house in St.&nbsp;Dennis&#x2014;-and she&#x2019;s learned a whole new skill set from Cameron. She can strip wallpaper and sling a hammer with the best of them now.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Whoever would have thought that the daughter of a Wall Street giant and one of the world&#x2019;s first supermodels would end up working as a carpenter in some little bayside town on the Chesapeake?&#x201d; Roberta mused.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I know, right? But she&#x2019;s doing exactly what she wants to do. If you could see how happy she is, you&#x2019;d understand.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to see her and meet this wonderful man of hers.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Cam&#x2019;s the best. Maybe you can visit sometime when I go to St.&nbsp;Dennis. And not to worry about that little bayside town. It&#x2019;s quite the place. You should look it up on the Web,&#x201d; Carly suggested.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll do exactly that. I don&#x2019;t know why I didn&#x2019;t think of it myself.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;So when will you be home?&#x201d; Carly asked.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Your father still has some business here in Portland,&#x201d; Roberta told her. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s personally been supervising the design of the new plant Summit Industries is building. You know how he is about the safety of his employees.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I do know. Everyone should be held to his standards.&#x201d; Patrick Summit was well known for his progressive efforts in plant safety and employee welfare.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;How&#x2019;s everything back in Connecticut?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s good. I appreciate you letting me move all those paintings into your house.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be silly. It&#x2019;s your family home. You&#x2014;-and your paintings&#x2014;-are welcome anytime. Stay as long as you like.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Normally I would stay at my own place, but your security here is so superior to what I have at the town house. I think the paintings are safer here.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;No need to explain. Though it does have me wondering just how good the security at your town house really is&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>They chatted for a few more minutes before Roberta said, &#x201c;I should let you get back to your work. I know you&#x2019;re eager to finish your book and start putting your exhibit together.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I know exactly where every painting will go. Well, at least until I change my mind again.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re still planning on debuting the collection in your New York gallery?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely. New York is the hub of the art world. I can&#x2019;t imagine doing this anywhere else.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;What about the other galleries? Who&#x2019;s minding the store while you&#x2019;re so focused on this one artist?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;You know I have great people working for me. Enrico is running New York, Helena is running Boston, and Colby has Chicago under control. London is still closed temporarily while they&#x2019;re making the repairs from that storm last month, but I&#x2019;m seriously considering selling my interests in London and Istanbul. I&#x2019;ve had long--standing offers on both, and I think it&#x2019;s time to divest.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure that you want to close yourself off from the European market?&#x201d; Ellie could hear the frown in her mother&#x2019;s voice.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t be. Isabella is capable of handling London on her own. Though she&#x2019;s made me an offer for my half, and I&#x2019;m strongly considering it.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Do you need the money?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;I need the time more than the money. As much as it pains me to admit it, I&#x2019;ve realized that I&#x2019;ve spread myself too thin. I&#x2019;m finding that my focus is beginning to narrow&#x2014;-I&#x2019;m more interested in providing a showcase for women artists. Besides, I don&#x2019;t feel that I need to prove myself anymore, not the way I did when I purchased those venues. I&#x2019;ve made my name.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;That you have. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll make the right decision. Well, good luck with it all. I see your email is here. I&#x2019;m hanging up so I can start reading immediately.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Let me know what you think as soon as you&#x2019;ve finished it. Love you. Love to Dad.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Carly stood and stretched after disconnecting the call. An unexpected yawn brought on an inner debate over whether or not to make a cup of coffee. Caffeine at this hour could keep her awake till dawn. On the other hand, she reasoned, she&#x2019;d probably be reading till the wee hours anyway. She made the coffee and carried the mug back to her desk, then settled in and resumed reading.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>She was halfway through one of Carolina&#x2019;s journals when she came across a loose piece of folded paper. Curious, she unfolded it, read it, then reread it, then read it again.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Holy shit. Could this even be possible?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Her heart beating faster, her hands shaking, she reached for the phone and speed--dialed Ellie&#x2019;s number.<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Ellie, there are more,&#x201d; she said breathlessly when her friend answered. &#x201c;She says there are more.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Ellie laughed. &#x201c;Who said there&#x2019;s more of what?&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Carolina. She made a list&#x2014;-&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>&#x201c;Whoa. Slow down. Take a deep breath and start over.&#x201d;<br></p><p> <br></p><p>Carly inhaled sharply, exhaled, then repeated the process.</p></p><h2>The Ambassadors (Penguin Classics)</h2><p><b>The greatest expression of his talent for witty, observant explorations of what it means to 'live well', Henry James's <i>The Ambassadors</i> is edited with an introduction and notes by Adrian Poole in Penguin Classics. <br></b><br> Concerned that her son Chad may have become involved with a woman of dubious reputation, the formidable Mrs Newsome sends her 'ambassador' Strether from Massachusetts to Paris to extricate him. Strether's mission, however, is gradually undermined as he falls under the spell of the city and finds Chad refined rather than corrupted by its influence and that of his charming companion, Madame de Vionnet, and her daughter, Jeanne. As the summer wears on, Mrs Newsome concludes that she must send another envoy to confront the errant Chad - and a Strether whose view of the world has changed profoundly. One of the greatest of James's late works, <i>The Ambassadors</i> is a subtle and witty exploration of different responses to a European environment. <br><br> This edition of The Ambassadors includes a chronology, further reading, glossary, notes and an introduction discussing the novel in the context of James's other works on Americans in Europe, and the novel's portrayal of Paris.</p><p><i>The Ambassadors</i>, which Henry James considered his best work, is the most exquisite refinement of his favorite theme: the collision of American innocence with European experience. This time, James recounts the continental journey of Louis Lambert Strether--a fiftysomething man of the world who has been dispatched abroad by a rich widow, Mrs. Newsome. His mission: to save her son Chadwick from the clutches of a wicked (i.e., European) woman, and to convince the prodigal to return to Woollett, Massachusetts. Instead, this all-American envoy finds Europe growing on him. Strether also becomes involved in a very Jamesian "relation" with the fascinating Miss Maria Gostrey, a fellow American and informal Sacajawea to her compatriots. Clearly Paris has "improved" Chad beyond recognition, and convincing him to return to the U.S. is going to be a very, very hard sell. Suspense, of course, is hardly James's stock-in-trade. But there is no more meticulous mapper of tone and atmosphere, nuance and implication. His hyper-refined characters are at their best in dialogue, particularly when they're exchanging morsels of gossip. Astute, funny, and relentlessly intelligent, James amply fulfills his own description of the novelist as a person upon whom nothing is lost. <i>--Rhian Ellis</i>Henry James considered his late novel The Ambassadors (1903) &#39;quite the best, &#39;all round&#39;&#39; of all his works. This volume based on the first book edition provides extensive annotations, a detailed textual history of the work and a full introduction exploring the novel&#39;s literary, cultural and historical contexts.</p><h2>Beating Guns: Hope for People Who Are Weary of Violence</h2><p><b>&#x2605; </b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><b> starred review<br></b><br>Parkland. Las Vegas. Dallas. Orlando. San Bernardino. Paris. Charleston. Sutherland Springs. Newtown. These cities are now known for the people who were shot and killed in them. More Americans have died from guns in the US in the last fifty years than in all the wars in American history. With less than 5% of the world's population, the people of the US own nearly half the world's guns. America also has the most annual gun deaths--homicide, suicide, and accidental gun deaths--at 105 per day, or more than 38,000 per year. Some people say it's a heart problem. Others say it's a gun problem. The authors of <i>Beating Guns</i> believe it's both.<br><br>This book is for people who believe the world doesn't have to be this way. Inspired by the prophetic image of beating swords into plows, <i>Beating Guns</i> provides a provocative look at gun violence in America and offers a clarion call to change our hearts regarding one of the most significant moral issues of our time. Bestselling author, speaker, and activist Shane Claiborne and Michael Martin show why Christians should be concerned about gun violence and how they can be part of the solution. The authors transcend stale rhetoric and old debates about gun control to offer a creative and productive response. Full-color images show how guns are being turned into tools and musical instruments across the nation. Charts, tables, and facts convey the mind-boggling realities of gun violence in America, but as the authors make clear, there is a story behind every statistic. <i>Beating Guns</i> allows victims and perpetrators of gun violence to tell their own compelling stories, offering hope for change and helping us reimagine the world as one that turns from death to life, where swords become plows and guns are turned into garden tools.</p><p><b>"Timely, relevant, and necessary"<br></b><br>More Americans have died from guns in the US in the last fifty years than in <b>all the wars in American history</b>.<br><br>Though the people of the United States total 5 percent of the world's population, they own almost <b>half the world's guns</b>.

Together they helped bring the Constitution into being, yet soon after the new republic was born they broke over the meaning of its founding document. Hamilton emphasized economic growth, Madison the importance of republican principles.<br>Jay Cost is the first to argue that both men were right--and that their quarrel reveals a fundamental paradox at the heart of the American experiment. He shows that each man in his own way came to accept corruption as a necessary cost of growth. <i>The Price of Greatness</i> reveals the trade-off that made the United States the richest nation in human history, and that continues to fracture our politics to this day.</p><p><b>Jay Cost </b>is a senior writer at the <i>Weekly Standard </i>and has written for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>National Review</i>, and <i>Commentary</i>.

Nothing we'd ever call <i>fun</i>. But what if we've gotten fun wrong? In <i>Play Anything,</i> visionary game designer and philosopher Ian Bogost shows how we can overcome our daily anxiety; transforming the boring, ordinary world around us into one of endless, playful possibilities.<br><br>The key to this playful mindset lies in discovering the secret truth of fun and games. <i>Play Anything,</i> reveals that games appeal to us not because they are fun, but because they set <i>limitations</i>. Soccer wouldn't be soccer if it wasn't composed of two teams of eleven players using only their feet, heads, and torsos to get a ball into a goal; Tetris wouldn't be Tetris without falling pieces in characteristic shapes. Such rules seem needless, arbitrary, and difficult. Yet it is the limitations that make games enjoyable, just like it's the hard things in life that give it meaning.<br><br>Play is what happens when we <i>accept</i> these limitations, narrow our focus, and, consequently, have fun. Which is also how to live a good life. Manipulating a soccer ball into a goal is no different than treating ordinary circumstances- like grocery shopping, lawn mowing, and making PowerPoints-as sources for meaning and joy. We can "play anything" by filling our days with attention and discipline, devotion and love for the world as it really is, beyond our desires and fears.<br><br>Ranging from Internet culture to moral philosophy, ancient poetry to modern consumerism, Bogost shows us how today's chaotic world can only be tamed-and enjoyed-when we first impose boundaries on ourselves.<br></p><p><b>Ian Bogost</b> is the Ivan Allen College Distinguished Chair in media studies and a professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a founding partner at Persuasive Games, and a contributing editor at <i>The Atlantic</i>.

The year saw a few new entries in the 'Tackle life's challenges like a game' category, a thesis that's gaining momentum, but this book goes deeper than most via an enlightening discussion of the role of limits in both games and life. Bogost strikes me as equal parts philosopher and savant game enthusiast-a systems thinker with a penchant for high score formulas-and I'm glad he wrote <i>Play Anything </i>because it's causing me to look at problems in a different way.

His life is ruined: an isolated scandal has assumed horrifying proportions. But, then he is befriended by an older man named Marlow who helps to establish him in exotic Patusan, a remote Malay settlement where his courage is put to the test once more. Lord Jim is a book about courage and cowardice, self-knowledge and personal growth. It is one of the most profound and rewarding psychological novels in English. Set in the context of social change and colonial expansion in late Victorian England, it embodies in Jim the values and turmoil of a fading empire. This new edition uses the first English edition text and includes a new introduction and notes by leading Conrad scholar Jacques Berthoud, glossaries, and an appendix on Conrad's sources and reading.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>When <i>Lord Jim</i> first appeared in 1900, many took Joseph Conrad to task for couching an entire novel in the form of an extended conversation--a ripping good yarn, if you like. (One critic in <i>The Academy</i> complained that the narrator "was telling that after-dinner story to his companions for eleven solid hours.") Conrad defended his method, insisting that people really do talk for that long, and listen as well. In fact his chatty masterwork requires no defense--it offers up not only linguistic pleasures but a timeless exploration of morality.<p> The eponymous Jim is a young, good-looking, genial, and naive water-clerk on the <i>Patna</i>, a cargo ship plying Asian waters. He is, we are told, "the kind of fellow you would, on the strength of his looks, leave in charge of the deck." He also harbors romantic fantasies of adventure and heroism--which are promptly scuttled one night when the ship collides with an obstacle and begins to sink. Acting on impulse, Jim jumps overboard and lands in a lifeboat, which happens to be bearing the unscrupulous captain and his cohorts away from the disaster. The <i>Patna</i>, however, manages to stay afloat. The foundering vessel is towed into port--and since the officers have strategically vanished, Jim is left to stand trial for abandoning the ship and its 800 passengers. </p><p> Stripped of his seaman's license, convinced of his own cowardice, Jim sets out on a tragic and transcendent search for redemption. This may sound like the bleakest of narratives. But <i>Lord Jim</i> is also touching, elevating, and often funny. Here, for example, the narrator describes the ship's captain (proving that clothes do indeed make the man): </p><blockquote> He made me think of a trained baby elephant walking on hind-legs. He was extravagantly gorgeous too--got up in a soiled sleeping suit, bright green and deep orange vertical stripes, with a pair of ragged straw slippers on his bare feet, and somebody's cast-off pith hat, very dirty and two sizes too small for him, tied up with a manilla rope-yarn on the top of his big head. You understand a man like that hasn't a ghost of a chance when it comes to borrowing clothes. </blockquote> This is formidable prose by any standard. But when you consider that Conrad was working in his third language, the sublime after-dinner story that is <i>Lord Jim</i> seems even more astonishing an accomplishment. <i>--Teri Kieffer</i>This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

Infants crawl and then walk, children learn to read and write, teenagers mature in myriad ways, the elderly become frail and forgetful. Beyond these natural processes and events, external forces and interventions instigate and disrupt change: test scores may rise after a coaching course, drug abusers may remain abstinent after residential treatment. By charting changes over time and investigating whether and when events occur, researchers reveal the temporal rhythms of our lives. <em>Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis</em> is a much-needed professional book for empirical researchers and graduate students in the behavioral, social, and biomedical sciences. It offers the first accessible in-depth presentation of two of today's most popular statistical methods: multilevel models for individual change and hazard/survival models for event occurrence (in both discrete- and continuous-time). Using clear, concise prose and real data sets from published studies, the authors take you step by step through complete analyses, from simple exploratory displays that reveal underlying patterns through sophisticated specifications of complex statistical models.<br> <br> <em>Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis</em> offers readers a private consultation session with internationally recognized experts and represents a unique contribution to the literature on quantitative empirical methods.<br><br> Visit http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/examples/alda.htm for:<br>� Downloadable data sets<br>� Library of computer programs in SAS, SPSS, Stata, HLM, MLwiN, and more<br>� Additional material for data analysis<br></p><p>John B.

It was one of those curious coincidences&#x2014;an inconsequential one&#x2014;as when we turn the corner and find ourselves face-to-face with the person we&#x2019;ve just been thinking about. Or when we answer the telephone and hear at the other end the voice of the friend we had been about to call. These things make us believe either in telepathy&#x2014;for which there is as little hard evidence as there is, alas, for the existence of Santa Claus&#x2014;or in pure chance, which we flatter ourselves into thinking plays a small role in our lives. Yet chance, Isabel thought, determines much of what happens to us, from the original birth lottery onwards. We like to think that we plan what happens to us, but it is chance, surely, that lies behind so many of the great events of our lives&#x2014;the meeting with the person with whom we are destined to spend the rest of our days, the receiving of a piece of advice which influences our choice of career, the spotting of a particular house for sale; all of these may be down to pure chance, and yet they govern how our lives work out and how happy&#x2014;or unhappy&#x2014;we are going to be.<br><br>It happened when she was walking with Jamie across the Meadows, the large, tree-lined park that divides South Edinburgh from the Old Town.

But even in the making of that resolution, she had found a line from Auden that seemed to express it all, and had given up on that ambition. And why, she asked herself, should one not quote those who saw the world more clearly than one did oneself?<br><br>Her north, her south; well, now they were walking north, on one of those prolonged Scottish summer evenings when it never really gets dark, and when one might forget just how far from south one really is. The fine weather had brought people out onto the grass; a group of young men, bare-chested in the unaccustomed warmth, were playing a game of football, discarded tee-shirts serving as the goal markers; a man was throwing a stick for a tireless border collie to fetch; a young couple lay stretched out, the girl&#x2019;s head resting on the stomach of a bearded youth who was looking away, at something in the sky that only he could see. The air was heavy, and although it would soon be eight o&#x2019;clock, there was still a good deal of sunlight about&#x2014;soft, slanting sunlight, with the quality that goes with light that has been about for the whole day and is now comfortable, used.<br><br>The coincidence was that Jamie should suddenly broach the subject of what it must be like to feel thoroughly ashamed of oneself. Later on she asked herself why he had suddenly decided to talk about that. Had he seen something on the Meadows to trigger such a line of thought? Strange things were no doubt done in parks by shameless people, but hardly in the early evening, in full view of passersby, on an evening such as this. Had he seen some shameless piece of exhibitionism? She had read recently of a Catholic priest who went jogging in the nude, and explained that he did so on the grounds that he sweated profusely when he took exercise. Indeed, for such a person it might be more convenient not to be clad, but this was not Sparta, where athletes disported naked in the palaestra; this was Scotland, where it was simply too <i>cold</i> to do as in Sparta, no matter how classically minded one might be.<br><br>Whatever it was that prompted Jamie, he suddenly remarked: &#x201c;What would it be like not to be able to go out in case people recognised you? What if you had done something so . . . so appalling that you couldn&#x2019;t face people?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabel glanced at him. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t, have you?&#x201d;<br><br>He smiled. &#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br><br>She looked up at the skyline, at the conical towers of the old Infirmary, at the crouching lion of Arthur&#x2019;s Seat in the distance, beyond a line of trees. &#x201c;Some who have done dreadful things don&#x2019;t feel it at all,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They have no sense of shame. And maybe that&#x2019;s why they did it in the first place. They don&#x2019;t care what others think of them.&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie thought about this for a moment. &#x201c;But there are plenty of others, aren&#x2019;t there? People who have done something out of character. People who have a conscience and who yet suddenly have given in to passing temptation. Some dark urge. They must feel ashamed of themselves, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabel agreed. &#x201c;Yes, they must. And I feel so sorry for them.&#x201d; It had always struck her as wrong that we should judge ourselves&#x2014;or, more usually, others&#x2014;by single acts, as if a single snapshot said anything about what a person had been like over the whole course of his life. It could say something, of course, but only if it was typical of how that person behaved; otherwise, no, all it said was that at that moment, in those particular circumstances, temptation won a local victory.<br><br>They walked on in silence. Then Isabel said, &#x201c;And what about being made to feel ashamed of what you are? About <i>being</i> who you are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But do people feel that?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabel thought that they did. &#x201c;Plenty of people feel ashamed of being poor,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They shouldn&#x2019;t, but many do. Then some feel ashamed of being a different colour from those around them. Again, they shouldn&#x2019;t. And others feel ashamed of not being beautiful, of having the wrong sort of chin. Of having the wrong number of chins. All of these things.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s ridiculous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course it is.&#x201d; Jamie, she realised, could say that; the blessed do not care from what angle they are regarded, as Auden . . . She stopped herself, and thought instead of moral progress, of how much worse it had been only a few decades ago. Things had changed for the better: now people asserted their identities with pride; they would not be cowed into shame. Yet so many lives had been wasted, had been ruined, because of unnecessary shame.<br><br>She remembered a friend&#x2019;s mother who had discovered, at the age of twelve, that she was illegitimate, that the father who had been said to have been killed in an accident was simply not there, a passing, regretted dalliance that had resulted in her birth. Today that meant very little, when vast cohorts of children sprang forth from maternity hospitals without fathers who had signed up to anything, but for that woman, Isabel had been told, the rest of her life, from twelve onwards, was to be spent in shame. And with that shame there came the fear that others would find out about her illegitimacy, would stumble upon her secret. Stolen lives, Isabel thought, lives from which the joy had been extracted; and yet we could not banish shame altogether&#x2014;she herself had written that in one of her editorials in the <i>Review of Applied Ethics</i>, in a special issue on the emotions. Without shame, guilt became a toothless thing, a prosecutor with no penalties up his sleeve.<br><br>They were on their way to a dinner party, and had decided to walk rather than call a taxi, since the evening was so inviting. Their host lived in Ramsay Garden, a cluster of flats clinging to the edge of the Castle Rock like an impossible set constructed by some operatic visionary and then left for real people to move into. From the shared courtyard below, several cream-harled buildings, with tagged-on staircases and balconies, grew higgledy-piggledy skywards, their scale and style an odd mixture of Arts and Crafts and Scottish baronial. It was an expensive place to live, much sought-after for the views which the flats commanded over Princes Street and the Georgian New Town beyond.<br><br>She had told Jamie who their hosts were, but he had forgotten, and he asked her again as they climbed the winding stairway to the topmost flat. She found herself thinking: Like all men, he does not listen. Men switch off and let you talk, but all the time something else is going on in their minds.<br><br>&#x201c;Fleurs-de-lis,&#x201d; said Isabel, running her hand along the raised plaster motifs on the wall of the stairway. &#x201c;Who are they? People I don&#x2019;t know very well. And I think that I owe them, anyway. I was here for dinner three years ago, if I remember correctly. And I never invited them back. I meant to, but didn&#x2019;t. You know how it is.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled at herself for using the excuse <i>You know how it is</i>. It was such a convenient, all-purpose excuse that one could tag it on to just about anything. And what did it say? That one was human, and that one should be forgiven on those grounds? Or that the sheer weight of circumstances sometimes made it difficult to live up to what one expected of oneself? It was such a flexible excuse, and one might use it for the trivial or the not so trivial. Napoleon, for instance, might say, <i>Yes, I did invade Russia; I&#x2019;m so sorry, but you know how it is.</i><br><br>Jamie ended her reverie. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve forgiven you,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Or they weren&#x2019;t counting.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have to invite people back?&#x201d; Isabel asked. &#x201c;Is it wrong to accept an invitation if you know that you won&#x2019;t reciprocate?&#x201d;<br><br>Jamie ran his finger across the fleurs-de-lis. &#x201c;But you haven&#x2019;t told me who they are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was at school with her,&#x201d; said Isabel. &#x201c;She was very quiet. People laughed at her a bit&#x2014;you know how children are. She had an unfortunate nickname.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which was?&#x201d;<br><br>Isabel shook her head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Jamie, I shouldn&#x2019;t tell you.&#x201d; That was how nicknames were perpetuated; how her friend, Sloppy Duncan, was still Sloppy Duncan thirty years after the name was first minted.</p><h2>Kingdom of Darkness: A Novel (Nina Wilde and Eddie Chase)</h2><p>For fans of James Rollins and Matthew Reilly comes a gripping, globe-spanning adventure in Andy McDermott&#x2019;s thrilling series featuring American archaeologist Nina Wilde and ex-SAS bodyguard Eddie Chase.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>History&#x2019;s most sought after treasure is now mankind&#x2019;s worst fear.</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> In Los Angeles, a desperate man seeks out renowned archaeologist Nina Wilde and her husband, ex&#x2013;SAS soldier Eddie Chase&#x2014;only to be gunned down in front of them.

In its wake, two gleaming black Mercedes SLS AMG sports cars skidded around the corner, their V8 engines snarling like enraged beasts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The gull-wing passenger door of the lead SLS swung upward. A man, face hidden behind a bandanna, leaned out. The malevolent little MAC-11 machine pistol in his hand barked, vivid spurts of flame longer than the weapon itself gouting from the barrel as he unleashed a spray of automatic fire at the Lamborghini.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Aventador&#x2019;s driver jerked the steering wheel to the left. The convertible whipped into a lane of oncoming traffic as sparks and dust spat up from the asphalt alongside it. An SUV rushed straight at it&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The driver swept up onto the sidewalk. Pedestrians screamed and leapt for safety. The Mercs continued their pursuit, the second car&#x2019;s gull-wing opening to reveal another masked man&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Holding an RPG-7 rocket launcher.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Danger behind&#x2014;and ahead. The street was blocked by a tanker truck.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No way around it&nbsp;. . .&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But there was a way <i>over</i> it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A panel van with a lowered rear ramp was parked at the curb, its interior empty save for some cardboard boxes. The driver swerved back onto the road, aiming his car directly at it&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And&nbsp;. . . <i>cut</i>!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Aventador came to a rapid stop. Behind it, both AMGs also slowed, wheeling around ready for the next take.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nina Wilde, standing beside a camera crane, responded to the action with a dismissive shrug. &#x201c;Y&#x2019;know, I don&#x2019;t think they ever got above thirty miles per hour,&#x201d; the redhead complained.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her husband was rather more impressed. &#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; said Eddie Chase, eyeing the Lamborghini with distinct automotive lust. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got to admit, being on a movie set is pretty cool.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, when something&#x2019;s actually happening.&#x201d; They had been on the imitation New York street for over an hour, and this was the first time the cameras had rolled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Macy Sharif nodded in agreement. &#x201c;Thank God for trailers,&#x201d; said the younger woman, indicating a large and luxurious mobile home parked at the end of the back lot. &#x201c;Grant&#x2019;s is kitted out better than his own apartment. And he&#x2019;s got a <i>really</i> nice apartment.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So you like life in Hollywood, then?&#x201d; Eddie asked with a grin. &#x201c;Being a model&#x2019;s better than being an archaeologist?&#x201d; The Englishman glanced sidelong at his wife, the grin becoming more cheeky. &#x201c;Always thought it must be.&#x201d; She jabbed him with her elbow in response.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I still <i>am</i> an archaeologist,&#x201d; Macy insisted. &#x201c;I got my degree&#x2014;yay!&#x2014;and I&#x2019;m starting on my master&#x2019;s soon. But&nbsp;. . . yeah,&#x201d; she admitted, smiling, &#x201c;being a model <i>was</i> cool. I&#x2019;ll show you the magazine later. I think you&#x2019;ll like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I will,&#x201d; said Eddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nina gave him a teasing look. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d better not like it <i>too</i> much. You&#x2019;re wearing clothes in it, �aren&#x2019;t you, Macy?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Of course I am!&#x201d; she replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nina looked her friend up and down. The dark-haired young Floridian was in cutoff denim shorts and a midriff-baring T-shirt, both garments tight enough to show off her toned figure. &#x201c;More than you are now?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A moment&#x2019;s consideration. &#x201c;Maybe&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Lamborghini pulled up in front of them and its door scissored open. Grant Thorn climbed out and called to a man in a baseball cap. &#x201c;How was that, Mikey?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The director was reviewing various camera angles on a bank of monitors. &#x201c;Lookin&#x2019; good, lookin&#x2019; good&nbsp;. . . yeah, print it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;And you can see it&#x2019;s really me driving?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, Grant, we can tell it&#x2019;s you.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Awesome.&#x201d; The tanned actor gave the director a thumbs-up, then embraced Macy, lifting her off her feet and spinning around with a &#x201c;Hey, babe!&#x201d; before turning to his guests. &#x201c;So? What d&#x2019;you think?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That was&nbsp;. . . cool,&#x201d; said Nina politely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eddie snorted. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t listen to her, she doesn&#x2019;t appreciate action movies.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey! I like <i>good</i> action movies,&#x201d; she objected.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Like mine, huh?&#x201d; said Grant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Er&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So what happens next?&#x201d; Eddie cut in before Nina could offer any film criticism. He gestured at the van. &#x201c;Hit the ramp, jump over the truck?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grant nodded. &#x201c;You got it, man. And one of the bad guys shoots a rocket, which hits the tanker, and the whole thing blows up while the Lambo&#x2019;s going over it. Boom! Obviously they&#x2019;re not using the real car for that, and the stunt guy&#x2019;s gonna be driving, but I&#x2019;d totally do it if they&#x2019;d let me.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nina looked unconvinced. &#x201c;Yeah, totally.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t wait to see it,&#x201d; said Eddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Afraid you&#x2019;ll have to, dude,&#x201d; Grant told him, with a slightly condescending chuckle. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll take them, like, four hours to set everything up. I&#x2019;m actually done for the day&#x2014;the second unit takes over from here.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, that&#x2019;s your whole day&#x2019;s work?&#x201d; said Nina. &#x201c;Driving a car down a fake street for thirty seconds?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;No, man, I did more than that!&#x201d; Grant replied, slightly affronted. &#x201c;I did my in-car close-ups before you guys got here. Mikey wanted the right light so I&#x2019;d look my best.&#x201d; He turned his head to show off his blandly handsome profile.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, yeah, you definitely need a break after working your arse off like that,&#x201d; said Eddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As always, the sarcasm went clean over Grant&#x2019;s perfectly gelled hair. &#x201c;I know, dude, I know. So, anyway, how are you guys? Macy tells me you&#x2019;re on a big vacation&#x2014;like a world tour or something?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You could say that,&#x201d; Nina replied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Cool! Where&#x2019;ve you been?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eddie started counting off places on his fingers. &#x201c;So far? Vietnam, Thailand, Australia, Italy, France, Spain, saw my family in England&nbsp;. . . We just started a bit of a West Coast tour here in the States. Did the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone, and after LA we&#x2019;re going on to San Francisco and up to Seattle.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of travel, dude,&#x201d; said Grant, impressed. &#x201c;So what made you decide to do it? You two are usually total workaholics. Well, <i>you</i> are, Nina,&#x201d; he added with a laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t return it. &#x201c;We just wanted a break,&#x201d; she said quietly. The faint sigh underlying her words attracted a curious look from Macy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The actor didn&#x2019;t notice, though. &#x201c;And when did you kick all this off?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Two months ago,&#x201d; Eddie told him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Two months! Hope you remembered to get all your frequent flier miles!&#x201d; Grant laughed again. &#x201c;But while you&#x2019;re in LA, everything&#x2019;s on me, okay? How do you like the limo?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The movie star had arranged for a stretch limousine to transport the couple around the city&#x2014;though its styling was not what Nina would have chosen. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s, ah, fine,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Thanks for organizing it for us. It beats taking cabs everywhere. Or having a rental car.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Eddie huffed. &#x201c;We could have been cruising around California in a Mustang GT500 convertible, but <i>nooo&nbsp;. . .</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, I remember how much you like your fast cars, man!&#x201d; Grant said. &#x201c;You know, that time you drove me through New York at, like, two hundred miles an hour? It actually helped my acting. When I did <i>Nitrous&nbsp;2,</i> whenever I was driving I just remembered how it felt, Method-style! I got some great reviews for that, so thanks, dude.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even the star&#x2019;s best reviews tended to feature the word <i>wooden,</i> so Eddie didn&#x2019;t want to imagine what his bad ones were like. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you mean <i>Ni-two-rous</i>?&#x201d; he asked, grinning. The predecessor of the movie currently shooting had been given the rather awkward moniker <i>Ni2rous.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grant waved a hand. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me started, man. Leno <i>and</i> Letterman both gave me crap for that when I was promoting it. I don&#x2019;t pick the titles.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t pronounce them either.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Dude, enough!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;At least you won&#x2019;t have any problems with this one,&#x201d; said Nina. She indicated a stack of equipment cases, which were labeled simply nitrous&nbsp;3.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah, that&#x2019;s just the working title,&#x201d; said Grant. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re getting a focus group to decide on the coolest option. Oh, hey, what do you think? The two titles we&#x2019;ve got are&nbsp;. . .&#x201d; He paused for dramatic effect. &#x201c;<i>Nitrous&nbsp;3: Overdrive</i> Or alternatively&nbsp;. . . <i>Nitrous&nbsp;3: Maximum Boost</i> Which one&#x2019;s best?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think either of them fully captures the subtle nuances of the series,&#x201d; said Nina, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Eddie agreed. &#x201c;It should be something more like <i>Nitrous&nbsp;3: Tits and Explosions!</i> With an exclamation mark.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a PG-13, so no boobies, man,&#x201d; Grant said with regret. Macy gave her boyfriend a huffy pout. &#x201c;I like the exclamation thing, though. I&#x2019;ll suggest that.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Nitrous&nbsp;3: Balderdash,&#x201d;</i> Nina added under her breath. <i>&#x201c;Nitrous&nbsp;3: Physics, Schmysics&nbsp;. . .&#x201d;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; said the actor, &#x201c;give me five minutes to get changed and we&#x2019;ll go have lunch. There&#x2019;s something I want to talk to you both about.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Husband and wife exchanged looks. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d; Nina asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Spoilers, man,&#x201d; Grant said with a cocky grin as he headed for his trailer. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find out soon.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was nearer ten minutes than five, but Grant eventually emerged, having changed from his character&#x2019;s costume of ultratight jeans and white T-shirt into a blue Italian suit and a pair of sunglasses. &#x201c;Very stylish,&#x201d; said Nina approvingly. As much as she loved Eddie, his usual outfit of considerably cheaper and looser T-shirt and jeans, allied with a scuffed black leather jacket, was not exactly high fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Grant replied, beaming. &#x201c;Thought I oughta look smart if we&#x2019;re talking business.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another exchange of puzzled glances. &#x201c;What business?&#x201d; demanded Eddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you soon. Come on, let&#x2019;s take a ride.&#x201d; Walking arm in arm with Macy, Grant led the couple to a golf cart. The actor at the wheel, they drove off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Nina looked up at the building fa�ades as they cruised past. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s amazing. They look so real.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;They <i>are</i> real,&#x201d; Eddie said with a mocking smile. &#x201c;They don&#x2019;t do everything with CGI yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know what I mean. They&#x2019;ve done a really good job of distilling New York. I know it&#x2019;s just painted plaster, but it&#x2019;s still quite impressive how realistic it is.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, if you want to see something from New York that&#x2019;s <i>really</i> impressive,&#x201d; Grant piped up, &#x201c;check this out.&#x201d; He turned at the next intersection, the freestanding four- and five-story mock-up buildings giving way to flatter frontages wrapped around the exterior of a soundstage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Macy looked over her shoulder at Nina. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll love this,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t believe it when I saw it. It&#x2019;s kinda freaky.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What is?&#x201d; Nina asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see,&#x201d; said Grant. The golf cart pulled up at a ramp leading to the soundstage door, outside which was stationed a uniformed security guard. &#x201c;Hey, my man!&#x201d; called the actor as he climbed out. &#x201c;Showing my friends the set. That cool with you?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The guard&#x2019;s expression suggested that it wasn&#x2019;t, but within the walls of a film studio, nobody dared challenge the wanderlust of an A-list star. &#x201c;No problem, Mr.&nbsp;Thorn,&#x201d; he said through his teeth as he proffered a clipboard. &#x201c;If they&#x2019;ll sign in here, please?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Come on, come on,&#x201d; Grant said excitedly. Macy, Nina, and Eddie scribbled their names, then followed him inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A strong scent of paint and fresh sawdust greeted them, the <i>thwack</i> of someone hammering nails echoing through the cavernous chamber. Before them was a huge wall, a mass of wooden panels supported by metal scaffolding and beams of rough raw pine that stretched almost to the lighting gantry high above. Nina had to tip her head back to take in its whole height. &#x201c;What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll know when you see it. Come on, around here.&#x201d; Grant led them along the stage&#x2019;s side, passing several workmen. He waved to them in greeting. &#x201c;My man! How you doing? Dude, good to see you. You too, guy. Hey, dude.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You know them all?&#x201d; Nina asked when they were past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not a one,&#x201d; replied Grant with a shrug. &#x201c;I do two or three movies a year, and there are, like, six hundred new people working on each of them. Keeps &#x2019;em all happy if I say hi, though.&#x201d; He paused at a set of double doors in the great wall. &#x201c;Okay, this is it. Go on in, Nina.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Intrigued, Nina advanced through the doors, walking into&#x2014;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, wow,&#x201d; she gasped.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment, she felt a bizarre sense of dislocation, as if she had traveled over two thousand miles in a single step. The room she had entered was very familiar: the lobby of the General Assembly building at the United Nations in New York. Three floors of elegantly curved white balconies overlooked the checkerboard floor of the public space, light through the tall ranks of windows opposite reflecting off the gleaming replica of Sputnik suspended overhead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Only&nbsp;. . . it wasn&#x2019;t quite right. Everything was compacted, squeezed down in scale, and the view of Manhattan outside was frozen in two dimensions. The corridor behind the reception desk that should have led deeper into the building was abruptly truncated by a green curtain. Even the light from outside was subtly wrong, the harsh glare of studio lamps instead of the warmer, more diffuse tones of sunlight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked back at her companions. Eddie appeared impressed by the replica, while Grant and Macy were grinning with anticipation. &#x201c;So?&#x201d; said Grant. &#x201c;You like it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it cool?&#x201d; added Macy. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just like being in the actual UN!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s pretty amazing,&#x201d; Nina replied, turning to take it all in. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s smaller than the real thing, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Grant nodded. &#x201c;Yeah, they had to squish everything to fit it into the stage. It&#x2019;ll look fine on camera, though. Put the right lens on, and they can make a broom closet look like a ballroom.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So what happens in here?&#x201d; asked Eddie. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s for <i>Nitrous&nbsp;3: Shit Explodes,</i> I don&#x2019;t suppose you&#x2019;ll be delivering any long speeches about world peace.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Nah, nothing boring like that, dude,&#x201d; said Grant cheerfully. He pointed toward the main entrance. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna smash thro...</p></p><h2>Y: The Last Man, Book 3, Deluxe Edition</h2><p>Y: THE LAST MAN is the gripping saga of Yorick Brown, an unemployed and unmotivated slacker who discovers that he is the only male left in the world after a plague of unknown origin instantly kills every mammal with a Y chromosome. Accompanied by his mischievous monkey and the mysterious Agent 355, York embarks on a transcontinental journey to find his girlfriend and discover why he is the last man on Earth.<br><br>Now, the entire critically acclaimed Y: THE LAST MAN saga written by Brian K. Vaughan, one of the writers of LOST, is collected into a series of oversized, hardcover editions. In this third volume, Yorick's unbalanced sister Hero tracks him to San Francisco, only to find him seemingly succumbing to the male-killing plague after losing his still-unused engagement ring to agents of the Setauket Ring. Plus, Yorick, Agent 355 and Dr. Mann ship out across the Pacific to Japan in pursuit of Yorick's stolen monkey Ampersand, whose innards may hold the key to mankind's future</p><p>Brian K. Vaughan is the Eisner Award-winning writer of Y: THE LAST MAN, EX MACHINA, RUNAWAYS, and PRIDE OF BAGHDAD. His newest work, with artist/co-creator Fiona Staples, is SAGA, an ongoing sci-fi/fantasy series from Image Comics that The Onion&#39;s A.V. Club called, &#34;the emotional epic Hollywood wishes it could make.&#34; Vaughan lives in Los Angeles, where he works as a writer and producer on various film and tv projects, including three seasons on the hit series LOST.Gr 10 Up&#x2013;This work reprints volumes 24-36 of the original comic series in a gorgeous hardcover edition. Yorick Brown and his capuchin monkey, Ampersand, are the lone male survivors of a planet-wide "gendercide." The loss of 48 percent of the population has thrown much of the planet into chaos, creating dangerous conditions for everyone&#x2013;especially the only man alive. Yorick makes his way to San Francisco, to Dr. Mann, who is trying to find the cause and cure for the male plague. Agent 355 shadows him and protects him from a variety of spies, fanatics, criminals, and nuts who would stand in his way. When Ampersand is kidnapped and whisked off to Japan, they must take to the seas to try and find him. The artwork is stunning, featuring the original strips and cover work. Muted tones and changing palettes are expertly used to convey mood and tone. The highly original plot is compelling and fast moving, with plenty of action. The use of flashbacks, hallucinations, and fantasies within the story line may confuse weaker readers. Most teens will want to read the previous volumes first. Harsh language, adult situations, and occasional partial nudity make this one most appropriate for public libraries.<i>Anthony C. Doyle, Livingston High School, CA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

It also shows him a spinner of tales and a creator of memorable characters. There is the grandfather who marches off in his best clothes to be buried in the next town, the sardonic &#34;senior reporter&#34; on a provincial newspaper, servant girls who know how to deal triumphantly with a fast-talking dandy, a twenty-year-old farmer preaching wildly to boys in a deserted barn, a group of respectable worthies who play at literature behind closed blinds, and always the observant and unfazed young Thomas. Few writers have evoked as successfully the mysteries and adventures of boyhood, of young love with its shattered dreams, or of death haunting two lads at play: none has done it in as fresh and telling phrases, with an elation as natural and contagious.The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas (1914&#x2013;1953) was one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. His work, noted for its lush metaphors, musicality, and playfulness within traditional forms, was largely responsible for modernizing poetic verse.</p><h2>The Engines of God</h2><p><b>The first Priscilla Hutchins novel from Jack McDevitt, hailed by Stephen King as&nbsp;<b>&#x201c;the logical heir to Isaac Asimov and Arthur C.

He is a multiple Nebula Award finalist who lives in Georgia with his wife Maureen.In the early years of the 23rd century, archaeology has expanded to the stars. Teams of linguists, historians, and engineers are excavating ruins on a number of planets in search of clues about the Monument-Makers, whose civilization was leaving its mark on distant worlds when our ancestors were inventing the wheel. Coming from a planet whose population has outgrown its resources, these archaeological teams must race to finish their work before colonists from Earth are sent to occupy these worlds. Priscilla ``Hutch'' Hutchins serves as pilot for one of the teams. Though untrained in archaeology, she's the one who first sees connections between the spectacular monuments left on various worlds and the peculiar, massive false cities made of solid cubes of rock. These cities, composed only of right angles, appear with regularity throughout the galaxy; all show signs of having been subjected to massive destructive forces. Scientific curiosity and grief over the accidental death of their leader take Hutch and the remains of the team to the edge of the galaxy. There they encounter the Monument- Makers and are faced with a mystery whose solution may hold the key to human survival. McDevitt (The Hercules Text, not reviewed) is at his best award-winning style in this intelligent and wide-ranging novel. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

That&#x2019;s what I told the recruiter. That&#x2019;s what I told my first squad leader. It&#x2019;s what I told every CO, and there were . . . a couple. And that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d tell myself, when I was alone in the dark, cut off from my platoon, the sky full of blistering red fire, too hot to send an evac unit, and a new kid was squealing and dying on the field.<br> <br>But it&#x2019;s not true.<br> <br>I signed up because of what they did to S�o Paulo. I signed up because of the Blink. All my heroes stayed on the path of light, no matter how dark it got. Even bleeding-heart socialist drones who play paladin can take an oath of vengeance to justify violence. I did.<br> <br>The enemy had eaten my family and the life I once knew; a past I now remember in jerky stutter-stops, like an old satellite image interrupted by a hurricane. I wanted to be the light: the savior, the hero, sure.<br> <br>But more than that, I wanted the enemy obliterated.<br> <br>How many other corporate soldiers signed up for money, or voting rights, or to clear a debt, or to afford good housing, or to qualify for a job in one of the big towers?<br> <br>I believed my reasons were nobler.<br> <br>When I signed up after S�o Paulo, me and my friends were shocked that the recruiting center wasn&#x2019;t packed. Where were all the patriots? Didn&#x2019;t they know what the aliens had done? I thought all those people who didn&#x2019;t sign up were cowards. While you were all upgrading your immersives and masturbating to some new game, we were fighting the real threat. We were the good guys.<br> <br>You were cowardly little shits.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t think about what would happen after I signed up. Or who I would need to become. I thought the world was simple: good guys and bad guys, citizens and ghouls, corporate patriots and socialist slaves.<br> <br>You were with us or against us.<br> <br>Pick your side.<br> <br>I was at a party not long after the Blink, drinking a jet-fuel tasting concoction out of a pulpy compostable bag, when a kid from my basic education class wandered over. I&#x2019;d signed up with the Tene-Silvia Corporate Corps with six friends, four of whom shipped out immediately. Me and the other two, Rubem Mujas and Andria Patel, managed to make the party. Rubem had gone inside, probably to pass out, leaving me and Andria on the lawn to answer everybody&#x2019;s questions. Andria was in high spirits. She didn&#x2019;t drink alcohol; her good cheer was all coltish excitement over our new career.<br> <br>&#x201c;You get a signing bonus?&#x201d; a snaggletoothed kid asked. &#x201c;They give you citizenship on the spot?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Andria laughed outright. Pushed back the heavy cascade of her black curls. Freckles smeared the apples of her cheeks. I remember thinking she was thin, back then, leggy and athletic, but I hadn&#x2019;t seen what true starvation did to a person, not until later.<br> <br>&#x201c;You have any other family but the ones they blitzed?&#x201d; asked another girl. I knew her from basic physics class, one sponsored by Teslova Energy.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Be kind,&#x201d; Andria said. &#x201c;The war has taken a lot from all of us. I look forward to bashing in alien heads.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard they&#x2019;ll teach you eighty ways to kill a man,&#x201d; the snaggle-toothed kid said, &#x201c;when you get to Mendoza.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to kill men,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I want to kill aliens.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard they were human once,&#x201d; the girl from physics said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bullshit,&#x201d; the other kid said. &#x201c;No human would do what they did to S�o Paulo.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll take away your name,&#x201d; said a tall guy coming over from under the balloon of the main party tent. &#x201c;I bet that&#x2019;s the biggest advantage for a ghoul like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grimaced. Franklin Kowalski outweighed me by over twenty-five kilos and was almost two meters tall; I had to kink my head up to meet his look. He had beaten me out for first-string quarterback two years before. All the streams preferred faces like his, the coach said, and the corp could only justify an American football team if they kept their viewership up. I could play second string. I told the coach to fuck herself and played two years of rugby instead, until the Blink. I didn&#x2019;t like people telling me what I could do.<br> <br>Ironic, then, signing up for the goddamn military.<br> <br>&#x201c;I hear they eat the rich in the corporate corps, Frankie,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;ll be delicious. Why wait to sign up?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Already did,&#x201d; he said. He hooked his big thumbs in his pockets and gave a wry little smile, the one I knew preceded the word-vomit of some shitty-ass thing he&#x2019;d just thought up.<br> <br>Andria rolled her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to check on Rube. He&#x2019;s probably vomiting into a messenger bag.&#x201d; She reached for my sleeve, but I stepped away from her.<br> <br>That was Andria&#x2014;always looking after me. And me? Always self-destructive.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know you&#x2019;ll have to fight the aliens,&#x201d; I said, before Frankie could get a word out, &#x201c;not just fuck them.&#x201d;<br> <br>The snaggletoothed kid snickered. Andria made a moue and got very still. The girl from physics got all big-eyed and turned abruptly and marched back to the party tent. She was probably the smartest of us all.<br> <br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t they call your dad Mad Dietz?&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;The one Teni had reeducated four times? I heard they sold him off to Evecom for stock options.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Go fuck yourself, Frankie,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>He leaned over me, faster than I expected&#x2014;I was a couple drinks in&#x2014;and mashed his tongue against my cheek, leaving a long tail of gin-soaked saliva. I recoiled, so startled I froze. I&#x2019;d think about that moment a lot, later. I&#x2019;d wonder what I should have done immediately, instead of freezing like a dumb kid. In some other time line things went differently. I would have broken his nose, kicked out his kneecap&#x2014;all in an instant. It&#x2019;s what a soldier would have done, what I would have done, later. But I didn&#x2019;t know anything about proper fighting&#x2014;just the grappling we did on the field. I hadn&#x2019;t been conditioned for violence. I still had to be provoked. If I&#x2019;d acted differently, I wouldn&#x2019;t be me. We wouldn&#x2019;t be here.<br> <br>He ducked away, laughing. &#x201c;You keep dreaming about that, you little fucking grunt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Andria said, &#x201c;Hey, leave it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>I leaped at Frankie in a full tackle. The smile fled. He went over.<br> <br>Yells from the crowd. Some cheers. Smell of grass and dirt and the chemical tang of fertilizer. Frankie slobbering, spitting at me. I shoved my elbow over his throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yield,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fuck you,&#x201d; he said, and punched my temple.<br> <br>A flash of bright light. Darkness juddering across my vision. I swung, but he was already up on his hands and knees. I tackled him again and bit down hard on his left ear.<br> <br>He screamed and clawed my face. A hunk of his ear came away. I tasted coppery salt. Spit the chewy bit of flesh.<br> <br>Somebody grabbed me then, many hands pulling me away and dragging Frankie up. The world spun. The thump-thump of the music inside beat in time to the throbbing in my head. My face was wet. He&#x2019;d busted my nose. The wet was blood. I bared my teeth. I spit up my blood and his. I raised a fist at the sky, blotting out the distorted specter of the moon. A great chunk of the moon was missing, had been for nearly a year. It still took some getting used to, that silhouette with the blinkering satellite of debris spinning around its equator. It had rained hellfire for weeks afterward, each shattered piece hurtling toward Earth like a nuclear warhead.<br> <br>&#x201c;You keep your eye up there,&#x201d; I yelled at him. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I&#x2019;ll come from when I kick your ass.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They only took you because you&#x2019;re a ghoul,&#x201d; Frankie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll be dead your first drop.&#x201d;<br> <br>The BLM&#x2014;Business Loss Management squad&#x2014;showed up, fit men and women wearing Kevlar and riot glasses, Tasers already out. They swarmed us from the mouth of the tent. Andria ran, probably to grab Rubem. She was already a good little citizen, and wasn&#x2019;t looking for trouble. I didn&#x2019;t blame her for ghosting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Shame,&#x201d; said the woman who zip-tied my hands. She turned the recording feature on her riot glasses off. I winced. The glasses were meant to reassure us that the agents weren&#x2019;t using personal retinal displays to record encounters with us. Personal retinal displays were worn as external lenses in the eyes; they were almost impossible to detect unless actively streaming data across the eye. I&#x2019;d been a ghoul long enough to know that a BLM agent turning off her external device was often prelude to a good beating&#x2014;or outright death.<br> <br>She leaned over me and whispered, &#x201c;Shame to get worked up with your whole future ahead, huh? You want to be a soldier?&#x201d; BLM&#x2019;s all had face recognition built into their riot interfaces and a direct line to our files. She no doubt knew all the intimate details of my last relationship and where I took a shit this morning.<br> <br>I kept quiet. Never talk to the BLM unless they invoke the Corporate Disclosure clause in your residency contract. My mom had drilled that into my head after we became residents of Tene-Silvia. She and my father had worked their asses off to get us all attached to a corp, but it came with a whole new set of rules.

MacDonald offers a provocative explanation of those scandalous words of Christ from the Fourth Gospelan explanation that he argues would hardly have surprised some of the Gospel&#39;s early readers. John sounds themes that would have instantly been recognized as proper to the Greek god Dionysos (the Roman Bacchus), not least as he was depicted in Euripides&#39; play The Bacchae. A divine figure, the offspring of a divine father and human mother, takes on flesh to live among mortals, but is rejected by his own. He miraculously provides wine and offers it as a sacred gift to his devotees, women prominent among them, dies a violent deathand returns to life. Yet John takes his drama in a dramatically different direction: while Euripides&#39;s Dionysos exacts vengeance on the Theban throne, the Johannine Christ offers life to his followers. MacDonald employs mimesis criticism to argue that the earliest Evangelist not only imitated Euripides but expected his readers to recognize Jesus as greater than Dionysos.</p><p><b>Dennis R.

Born in Berlin, in 1922 she became a student at the Bauhaus in Weimar, where she met her husband, Josef Albers. From 1933 to 1949 Albers taught at Black Mountain College. The fifteen essays gathered here illustrate Anni Albers's concept of design as the pursuit of wholeness &#x2015; "the coalition of form answering practical needs and form answering aesthetic needs." This beautifully illustrated book addresses the artistic and practical concerns of modern design and considers the ever-changing role of the designer.<br><br>Albers's work is in private collections and in those of leading museums both here and abroad. Among them are the Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard University, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Museum Neue Sammlung in Munich, the Bauhaus Archiv in Berlin, and the Museum of Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York. Her previous books include On Weaving (1965) and On Designing (1961), both published by Wesleyan</p><p>8 1/2 x 10 trim. 25 color illus."Anni Albers brings an extraordinary order to weaving. She distinguishes 'useful' weaving (the worn, walked-on, and sat-upon) from the 'useless' (the pictorial), but in her hands both share the virtue of being unique as works of art. Masterful with the hand loom, Anni Albers exerts a similar mastery over the machine in so ordering her design that the machine also produces a work of art." -- Paul Schweikher, former Head of the Department of Architecture, Carnegie Institute of Technology <p>"The weavings of Anni Albers have bridged the gap between craft and art. They stand on their own as complete and thoughtful statements of her approach to life and to design." -- Cecil Lubell, former Executive Editor of American Fabrics Magazine </p><p>"How do we choose our specific material, our means of communication? Accidentally. Something speaks to us, a sound, a touch, hardness or softness, it catches us and asks us to be formed. We are finding our language, and as we go along we learn to obey their rules and their limits. We have to obey and adjust to those demands. Ideas flow from it to us and though we feel to be the creator we are involved in a dialogue with our medium. The more subtly we are tuned to our medium, the more inventive our actions will become." -- Anni Albers</p></p><h2>String, Felt, Thread: The Hierarchy of Art and Craft in American Art</h2><p><p><i>String, Felt, Thread</i> presents an unconventional history of the American art world, chronicling the advance of thread, rope, string, felt, and fabric from the "low" world of craft to the "high" world of art in the 1960s and 1970s and the emergence today of a craft counterculture. In this full-color illustrated volume, Elissa Auther discusses the work of American artists using fiber, considering provocative questions of material, process, and intention that bridge the art-craft divide.</p><p>Drawn to the aesthetic possibilities and symbolic power of fiber, the artists whose work is explored here-Eva Hesse, Robert Morris, Claire Zeisler, Miriam Schapiro, Faith Ringgold, and others-experimented with materials that previously had been dismissed for their associations with the merely decorative, with "arts and crafts," and with "women's work." In analyzing this shift and these exceptional artists' works, Auther engages far-reaching debates in the art world: What accounts for the distinction between art and craft? Who assigns value to these categories, and who polices the boundaries distinguishing them?</p><p><i>String, Felt, Thread </i>not only illuminates the centrality of fiber to contemporary artistic practice but also uncovers the social dynamics-including the roles of race and gender-that determine how art has historically been defined and valued.</p></p><p>Elissa Auther is associate professor of contemporary art at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.</p><h2>Naked Came the Florida Man: A Novel (Serge Storms, 23)</h2><p><p><strong>The &#x201c;compulsively irreverent and shockingly funny&#x201d; (<em>Boston Globe</em>) Tim Dorsey returns with an insanely entertaining tale in which the inimitable Serge A.

But the crowded, glittering resort is far from peaceful, especially when the lifeless body of a beautiful young society miss is discovered in the bedchamber of none other than George Gordon&#x2014;otherwise known as Lord Byron.

She lives near Denver, Colorado.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br>Summons from London 25 April 1813 Sloane Street, London<br><br>Mr. Wordsworth or Sir Walter Scott should never struggle, as I do, to describe Spring in Chawton: the delight of slipping on one's bonnet, in the fresh, new hour before breakfast, and securing about one's shoulders the faded pelisse of jaconet that has served one so nobly for countless Aprils past; of walking alone into the morning, as birdsong and tugging breezes swell about one's head; of the catch in one's throat at the glimpse of a fox, hurrying home to her kits waiting curled and warm in the den beneath the Park's great oaks. Spring--in all its rains and clinging mud, its sharp green scents full-blown on the nose, and a newborn foal in the pasture below the Great House!<br><br>And in this glorious season, too, a splendid change has come upon the little Hampshire village I call my own--for my elder brother, the rich and distinguished Mr. Edward Austen Knight, as he and all his numerous progeny must now stile themselves, having acceded to his benefactor's surname as well as his estates in Kent and Hampshire--has descended in state upon Chawton Great House, with his full retinue of trusted servants, under-gardeners, grooms, coachmen, and what I am pleased to call Edward's Harem: a hopeful clutch of motherless daughters, most too young to marry and still at home.<br><br>Edward intends to spend the better part of the summer in the antiquated pile that once was let to our dear neighbours, the Middletons, Mr. John Middleton having determined to give up the place when his treaty was run. While the Austen Knights idle away June and July in Hampshire, their principal seat--Godmersham Park, in Kent--will submit to refurbishment, the interiors having grown sadly shabby without Edward's late wife's care. It is quite a treat to have one's relations--and all the elegancies of table, coach, and society--but a stone's throw from one's door; and I spun many happy webs for myself that bright April morning, as I walked through the meadows, and listened to the song of a blackbird hidden somewhere in the hedgerow. Edward's eldest daughter, Fanny, is full twenty years old--and although a trifle subdued for my taste, and possessed of starched notions quite appalling in one so young, she must be adjudged a welcome addition to the Cottage circle, whenever she may venture through the village in search of trifles and laughter. It was possible, I thought, that Martha Lloyd and I between us might be of use to poor dear Fanny, in enlarging her spirit and mind--or at the very least, her capacity for wit. There is nothing so quelling in a young woman, I find, as a want of humour; but much must be forgiven the girl--she was thrust too young into the r�le of Mother, when Elizabeth died. Fanny cannot have been more than fifteen, then; and at twenty, must feel already as though she has lived two lifetimes, in managing her father's household. She is certain to find Chawton unutterably dull, however; the Assemblies in Alton are not such as she has been used to, in the elegant Kentish circle she frequents. Was there, I wondered, any young man in the neighbourhood capable of engaging her interest?<br><br>Considering and discarding the various scions of local families as I walked amidst the dew-laden grass, I was full of pleasurable schemes that dreadful morning. Once Fanny was dismissed as too dear a prize for Alton's youth, my mind revolved the various attractions of an altogether different cut of gentleman--one Henry Crawford: for I have reached a most delicious point in the writing of my third novel, which is to be called Mansfield Park, when I must decide whether another Fanny (a sober and rather humourless young woman entirely of my own invention, though not quite my niece) is to make the roguish creature the Happiest of Men, or cast him into the Depths of Misery at a single word.<br><br>I had turned towards home after a brisk half-hour of exercise and rambling thought; when all at once it was as though a cloud moved swiftly across the sun, and my pleasure in the day was blotted out. The very air felt chill. I stopped short a good thirty paces from the Cottage door, a feeling of deepest dread in my heart--and for why? Only that a handsome chestnut hack was tethered to the post in the lane, one I recognised as my nephew Edward's mount. Why should a morning call, even one paid so unfashionably before breakfast, have the power to stop my heart?<br><br>I ran the final distance to the door.<br><br>My brother's eldest son and heir was standing before the fire, dressed not for hacking about the countryside in buckskins and boots, but for Town; his cravat meticulously tied, shirt points terrifyingly starched; a striped waistcoat trimly buttoned over primrose-coloured pantaloons. An Oxford lad of nearly nineteen, he had stiled himself a Corinthian of the First Stare; and it was this unwonted grandeur, as well as the expression of scared dignity on his young countenance, that informed me my heart had not erred. Disaster was in the air.<br><br>"What is it?" I whispered.<br><br>Cassandra came to me then, and enfolded me in her arms.<br><br>"An Express from Henry, to the Great House," she said.<br><br>"Has she gone?" I faltered. "And none of us aware?"<br><br>Edward cleared his throat. "Not quite gone, Aunt. But failing, Uncle Henry says. She is asking for you, I believe. Father says you are to travel up to London as soon as may be--in his chaise--and I am to bear you company."<br><br>"Edward!" I stared at him. "I am sure you should much rather be hunting rabbits on such a fine morning."<br><br>"So I should, ma'am," he stammered, "but under the circumstances--no exertion too great--should consider it an honour--wish most earnestly that you will accept my escort." He bowed stiffly, his face flushing with embarrassment. "Not the thing, you know--lady travelling entirely alone. Might very well be offered an intolerable insult. Besides, m'father commands it."<br><br>Edward, whom I cared for and cajoled so many years since, when his own mother died--to be offering me escort! I understood, then, the punctiliousness of his manner and dress. My nephew was representing his House--and paying off a debt of gratitude. I should be churlish to protest further; and besides, the hour was already advancing.<br><br>I uttered not another word, but dashed upstairs to throw what swift provision I could into a carpet bag. My beloved Eliza, Comtesse de Feuillide, wife of Mr. Henry Austen of Sloane Street--was dying. It seemed far too bitter a truth for Spring.<br><br>When did she first apprehend her mortal sickness, I wondered for the thousandth time as the chaise jolted and swayed over the Hog's-back an hour later?* Was it so early as my descent on London some two years since, for the proofing of the typeset pages of Sense and Sensibility? She suffered then, as I recall, from a trifling cold, and took to her bed on the strength of it; but surely that was a deliberate indulgence, to avoid the necessity of attending Divine Service of a particular Sunday?<br><br>Eliza was never very fond of Divine Service; she had seen too much of Sin, to place her faith in either repentance or redemption; and she felt certain that the clergy were the very last sort of men to lecture their brethren--indeed, she declared the whole pious enterprise an essay in hypocrisy. Eliza preferred to live her life and leave her neighbours to live theirs, without the benefit of unwanted advice or inspection; and on the whole, I confess I admire her philosophy. There is a great deal of disinterested benevolence in it.<br><br>If not April of 1811, then, the illness came upon Eliza soon after: a mass in the breast, that grew until it might almost have formed another--with tenderness, increasing pain, and suppuration. She had watched over her mother's dying of the selfsame malady, years since. She recognised the Enemy.<br><br>My incorrigible Eliza. My gallant friend. A word for gentlemen of high courage--but courage she brought to this final battle, knowing full well she would never triumph. The summer months of 1812 she spent in travel--relished two weeks in the sea air of Ramsgate in October--wished me joy of Pride and Prejudice's sale to Mr. Egerton in November (which met with decided success at its publication this winter among the Fashionables of the ton!)--and by Christmas was rapidly declining.<br><br>And Henry?<br><br>I might have said that he has not the mind for Affliction; he is too busy; too active; too sanguine. All the increasing cares of banking--my Naval brother Frank being now a partner in Henry's concern--and the activity necessary to a gentleman in the prime of his life, must inevitably attach Henry to the world. Add to this, that Eliza is fully ten years my brother's senior, and that the gradual progression of the disease has offered an interval for resignation and acceptance--and we may apprehend the steadiness with which Henry meets his impending loss. And yet--his summons to me surely augurs an unquiet mind, a soul in need of comfort. To part with such a companion as Eliza! --Who, though she gave him no child, brought him endless cheer and laughter from the first day he met her, as a boy of fifteen, when she descended � la comtesse on the Steventon parsonage, and dazzled us all within an inch of our lives.<br><br>"I believe Uncle Henry intends to give up Sloane Street," Edward observed as we rolled into Bagshot. "He claims he cannot bear to meet with my aunt's memory at every stair and corner."<br><br>"Better to remove from London, then," I managed, my throat constricted, "for Eliza shall haunt every bit of it."<br><br>I have known the journey from Chawton to run full twelve hours, when leisure permitted; but we were to have no dawdling nuncheon, no walking before the coachman in admiration of April flowers, no pause for fine views as we descended the final stage into the Metropolis. Barely eight hours elapsed from the moment I bade farewell to Cassandra at the Cottage door, until I found myself alighting in Sloane Street.<br><br>We met the surgeon, Mr. Haden, on the threshold--Madame Bigeon being on the point of ushering the good man out, as we ushered ourselves within--and paused, despite a scattering of rain, to learn his opinion.<br><br>"I fear she is sinking, Miss Austen," he informed me sombrely. "A matter of hours must decide it. I have left a quantity of laudanum--you are to give her twenty drops, in a glass of warm water, as she requires it."<br><br>"But Eliza detests laudanum!" I cried. "I have known her dreams to be frightful under its influence."<br><br>"Her agony will be the more extreme without it." The surgeon doffed his hat to Edward and me, and stepped past us to the street.<br><br>"Mademoiselle Jane!" Mme. Bigeon's elderly voice quavered on the greeting; she gave way that we might enter the hall, her black eyes filled with tears. "At last you are come! I feared--but it is not too late. She sleeps much, yes, but she will wake for you, mon Dieu! Come to her at once!"<br><br>With unaccustomed familiarity--such is the strength of feeling in the face of Eternity--the old Frenchwoman grasped my hand and drew me swiftly up the stairs. I could not stay even to loose my bonnet strings; and that I should be aware of such a nothing on the point of seeing Eliza, must be an enduring reproach. I am ashamed to own it.<br><br>Mme. Bigeon hesitated before the bedchamber door; it was ajar, so that I could just glimpse the outline of the bedstead, my brother Henry dozing in a straight-backed chair set up against the wall; and the silhouette of Mme. Marie Perigord--the old woman's daughter and Eliza's dresser, her constant reminder of all the glories of France that are gone beyond recall. Manon, as she is called, was seated near the bed, her sharp-featured face thrown into relief by the flame of a single candle; in her hand was a small bowl.<br><br>And beyond--<br><br>Eliza.<br><br>Her eyes were closed, her breathing heavy; a few damp locks of hair escaped from her white cap. There was a peculiar odour on the air--a sweet, sickly smell that emanated from the open wound in her breast, and the great tumor lying malevolently there; no amount of warm compresses or fresh linen could blot out the taint.<br><br>I crept softly to the bedside, young Edward hesitating behind me.<br><br>Manon rose and drew back her chair. "Monsieur--mademoiselle . . . I cannot persuade her to take any of the broth. And it is Maman's best broth, made from a pullet. Five hours it has been simmering on the stove--"<br><br>"Hush," Henry muttered, as he jerked awake. My brother's dazed eyes met mine through the shuttered gloom. "Ah--Jane! You are come at last!"<br><br>He rose, and pulled me close; the stale odour of a closed room, and clothes too infrequently exchanged, clung about his person. Henry--who is the nearest example of a Dandy the Austens may claim--had been neglecting himself.<br><br>"Praise God you came in time," he whispered.<br><br>"Mademoiselle!" Manon tugged impatiently at my sleeve. "Perhaps you will try? Perhaps she will take some broth from you, hein?"<br><br>"What does it matter?" Henry burst out, worn beyond bearing.<br><br>"But she must keep up her strength!" the maid protested.<br><br>Pointless to observe that strength would avail her mistress nothing, now.<br><br>Manon's face crumpled into a terrible grimace and she began, painfully, to weep, turning away from the awkward crowd of Austens as though we had caught her at something shameful. Mme. Bigeon swept her daughter out of the room, murmuring softly in her native tongue, half-scolding. I had an idea of the maid's high pitch of nerves, waiting in that darkened chamber through all the hours of a night and day as her mistress's life slowly ebbed, ears pricked for the sound of a particular set of horses halting in the street below. How like Eliza to hold on to the last, as though she knew I was hastening towards her!<br><br>But was she even aware of my presence?<br><br>"Dearest," Henry whispered, bending over Eliza. "Here is Jane arrived from Chawton."<br><br>Her eyelids flickered; the clouded gaze fixed for an instant on my brother's face, unseeing. How great a change was come upon that sprite, that eager, winning countenance! And how helpless I felt, unable to save her, to forestall the dreaded end!<br><br>I took up the bowl of broth and the silver spoon still warm from Manon's hand, leaned close to my dying cousin, and whispered, "Come, my darling, and try a little--to please your Jane."<br><br>* The Hog's-back is a narrow ridge that runs between Farnham and Guildford; the road traveled by the Austens on their journey to London ran along the summit and offered excellent views of some six counties. --Editor's note.</p><h2>A Civil Campaign</h2><p>Miles Vorkosigan falls in love with beautiful widow Ekaterin Vorsoisson, and despite her fierce opposition to marriage, he pursues a cunning plan to win her heart. Reprint.</p><p>If you relish costume adventure in an intergalactic society starring strong, convincing male <i>and</i> female characters, you'll adore the Vorkosigan Series. If you haven't met Miles Vorkosigan, whose brilliance, manic energy, and unstoppable determination make him a larger-than-life hero despite his dwarfish stature, pick up <i>Komarr</i> and <i>A Civil Campaign</i>. Read them, and then go back and catch the previous <i>nine</i> books (10 if you count <i>Ethan of Athos</i>, which features not Miles but his partner, Ellie Quinn); or read the series in order, starting with the romance of Miles's parents in <i>Shards of Honor</i>. <p> <i>A Civil Campaign</i> opens where <i>Komarr</i> ends, with Miles determined to court Ekaterin. Unfortunately, his approach is described as "General Romeo Vorkosigan, the one-man strike force." By his <i>father</i>. The potential for comic disaster increases when Miles's clone brother Mark arrives. He's brought a brilliant but scatterbrained scientist who's created a bug producing a perfect food: bug butter.

But now Kareen's living at home. Naturally, disaster strikes, repeatedly and on all fronts.</p><p> Bujold unfolds her comedy of manners while continuing to explore familiar themes: the difficulties in becoming a strong adult woman in a patriarchy, the need for trust and honesty in relationships between the sexes, the difference between appearance and identity, and the impact of advanced biotechnologies on society. <i>A Civil Campaign</i> is a sure-fire Hugo and Nebula nominee, likely to add another statue to Bujold's already full shelf.

Or will we see this threat ravage populations as others have before 1918 with influenza, in the late 18th century with yellow fever, or the horrific "black "death" or bubonic plague in 1347 A.D.?</p><p>Are these [viruses] examples of evolution? ...Did God make microbes by mistake?

These timely questions are examined throughout this book. -<em>from chapter 1</em></p><p>It seems that a new and more terrible disease is touted on the news almost daily. The spread of these scary diseases from avian flu to SARS to AIDS is a cause for concern and leads to questions, such as:</p><ul><li>Where did all these germs come from?</li><li>How do they fit into a biblical world view?</li><li>What kind of function did these microbes have before the Fall?</li><li>Does antibiotic resistance in bacteria prove evolution?</li><li>How can something so small have such a huge, deadly impact on the world around us?</li></ul><p>Professor Alan Gillen sheds light on these and many other questions in this revealing and detailed book.

From the dizzy era of Prohibition through the dark days of the Second World War, he was a desperate nation's most beloved entertainer. But he was more than just a charismatic crooner: Bing Crosby redefined the very foundations of modern music, from the way it was recorded to the way it was orchestrated and performed. <br><br>In this much-anticipated follow-up to the universally acclaimed first volume, NBCC Winner and preeminent cultural critic Gary Giddins now focuses on Crosby's most memorable period, the war years and the origin story of <em>White Christmas</em>. Set against the backdrop of a Europe on the brink of collapse, this groundbreaking work traces Crosby's skyrocketing career as he fully inhabits a new era of American entertainment and culture. While he would go on to reshape both popular music and cinema more comprehensively than any other artist, Crosby's legacy would be forever intertwined with his impact on the home front, a unifying voice for a nation at war. Over a decade in the making and drawing on hundreds of interviews and unprecedented access to numerous archives, Giddins brings Bing Crosby, his work, and his world to vivid life--firmly reclaiming Crosby's central role in American cultural history.</p><p>Gary Giddins wrote the Weather Bird jazz column in the <em>Village Voice</em> for over 30 years and later directed the Leon Levy Center for Biography at the CUNY Graduate Center. He received the National Nook Critics Circle Award, the Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award, and the Bell Atlantic Award for <em>Visions of Jazz: The First Century </em>in 1998. His other books include <em>Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams-The Early Years, 1930-1940</em>, which won the Ralph J. Gleason Music Book Award and the ARSC Award for Excellence in Historical Sound Research; <em>Weatherbird: Jazz at the Dawn of Its Second Century; Faces in the Crowd; Natural Selection; Warning Shadow; </em>and biographies of Louis Armstrong and Charlie Parker. He has won six ASCAP-Deems Taylor Awards, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Peabody Award in Broadcasting. He lives in New York, NY.Someone has to make the case for Crosby's historical importance-and fortunately for Bing, Gary Giddins has taken up the gauntlet with surprising vehemence. Mr. Giddins is one of the leading music critics of the last half-century."&#x2015;<b>Ted Gioia</b>, <b><i><i><b>Wall Street Journal</b></i></i></b><br><br><strong>Praise for <em>Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams</em></strong><br><br>"Gary Giddins may be the best thing to happen to Bing Crosby since Bob Hope.... Crosby couldn't have hoped for a finer biographer: elegant writer, informed historian, thorough scholar, and one of America's most eminent jazz critics."&#x2015;<b><i>John McDonough, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></i></b><br><br>"This is, quite simply, the best-researched, best-written, most entertaining music biography I've read."&#x2015;<b><i>Merrill Noden, <em>Mojo</em></i></b><br><br>"In Volume 2 of his Churchillian-scale chronicle, [Giddins] magnifies six years that confirm Crosby's primacy among the searchlights of American music and identity. The word "definitive" seems petite. Presumably, further volumes are coming...In Giddins care, they likely will be equally compelling in their context. But the war years period has a glory that seems to live in a precious "Golden age" of the imagination."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Downbeat Magazine </b></i></i></b><br><br>"Phenomenal smarts and critical acumen.... A formidable biographer and exegetical wonder, Gary Giddins is so persuasive that even the most skeptical post-Boomer should close the book with the eerie sensation that it's Bing's world after all--we just live in it."&#x2015;<b><i>James Marcus, <em>Atlantic Monthly</em></i></b><br><br>"Giddins packs exhaustive research and detail into his sprawling narrative while keeping the prose relaxed and vivid, and sprinkles in shrewd critical assessments of Crosby's music and films. Crosby emerges as an aloof, cool cat, and Giddins's engrossing show-biz bio richly recreates the popular culture he helped define."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review</i></b><br><br>"It's been almost 18 years since the publication of <i>Bing Crosby: A Pocketful of Dreams</i>, Gary Giddins's intelligent and formidably well-informed biography covering the entertainer's life from his birth in 1903 through the film that launched his mega-grossing partnership with Bob Hope. <i>Bing Crosby: Swinging on a Star</i> was the worth the wait. [An] evocative portrait of a man and a historical moment."<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>The Washington Post</b></i></i></b><br><br>"A deeply researched and thoroughly engrossing biography that confirms Crosby's essential role in the history of American music and film during a crucial period of the 20th century....Impressively maintains a balanced view of Crosby's complex character: an affable, hardworking performer admired by his peers and audience but also a man with values and ideas representative of his generation and piously Catholic upbringing. Ultimately, the author establishes Crosby's relevancy as an indisputable talent worth fair consideration from future generations. <br>&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i>, starred review</b></i></b><br><br>"For a twenty-firstcentury audience, the idea of Bing Crosby as both a swoonworthy movie idol and an inspiration to battlehardened soldiers may seem difficult to comprehend, but that is the brilliance of Giddins' work: he makes us see how, in a very different time, Crosby's easygoing, waggish style was just what the country craved, on records and radio, at the movies, and in person.

Instead she fixated on small, irrelevant details&#x2014;�a scuff on the other woman&#x2019;s shoe, indentations on the carpet where her chair had been moved&#x2014;�as she tried to put her fears into words. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the question I&#x2019;ve been asking myself recently,&#x201d; she went on. &#x201c;And the thing that&#x2019;s worrying me is . . . is that I&#x2019;m not sure it has.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaine leaned forward, adjusting her glasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m curious why you&#x2019;d say that. You&#x2019;ve already achieved more in your life than most people&#x2014;�I mean, it&#x2019;s fair to say that you&#x2019;re the most famous archaeologist in the world. You found Atlantis, you discovered the lost city of El Dorado, a hidden Egyptian pyramid, and all those other amazing things. That&#x2019;s something to be proud of, surely?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it?&#x201d; Nina caught herself leaning back in her seat, as if subconsciously trying to maintain the distance between them. &#x201c;Yeah, I found all those things&#x2014;�and I got a lot of people killed in the process. Too many people.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t kill them personally.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some of them I did.&#x201d; Even without looking directly at Elaine, she could sense the psychotherapist&#x2019;s shock at the revelation. &#x201c;They were trying to kill me, it was always in self-�defense . . . but yeah, I&#x2019;ve killed people. And you know what&#x2019;s really scary? I&#x2019;ve lost count of how many.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaine hurriedly scribbled a note. &#x201c;I see.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina gave her a grim smile. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to have me committed to Bellevue, are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no,&#x201d; the dark-�haired woman hastily assured her. &#x201c;I actually think it&#x2019;s good that you feel able to tell me about it at this relatively early stage. If you remember, when we started these sessions last month, it was quite a challenge for you to open up about anything at all. The very nature of post-�traumatic stress causes sufferers to try to internalize it&#x2014;�there&#x2019;s a great deal of anger, guilt&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about it,&#x201d; Nina muttered.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid it doesn&#x2019;t work that way,&#x201d; said Elaine, with sympathy. &#x201c;You have to tell me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You want me to tell you about my guilt?&#x201d; Nina snapped. &#x201c;Okay&#x2014;�about four months ago, one of my friends was murdered right in front of me. And it was all my fault! Macy wouldn&#x2019;t have been there if not for me . . .&#x201d; Her voice faded to inaudibility.<br><br>A long silence was eventually broken by the psychotherapist. &#x201c;Nina . . . are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I was okay, I wouldn&#x2019;t be seeing a shrink, would I?&#x201d; the redhead replied, wiping her eyes. &#x201c;What kind of a stupid question is that?&#x201d;<br><br>Elaine shrugged off the insult with professional calm. &#x201c;Tell me about Macy. I know you&#x2019;re reluctant, but I really think it would help. Please,&#x201d; she added, seeing her patient clench her fists. &#x201c;In your own time; you don&#x2019;t have to say anything if you don&#x2019;t want to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For a hundred and fifty bucks an hour, I&#x2019;m not going to sit here in silence. I could do that for free at Starbucks, and the coffee would be better.&#x201d; Nina took a deep breath, then a second, before continuing. &#x201c;Macy . . . she was an archaeology student when I first met her. She had a case of&#x201d;&#x2014;�a brief smile at the memory&#x2014;�&#x201c;hero worship.&#x201d; Her expression darkened once more. &#x201c;Spending time with me soon cured her of that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she was your friend,&#x201d; Elaine said.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. She could be annoying&#x2014;�God, she could be annoying!&#x2014;�but yeah, she was. She was young, that was all. And she thought life was there to be enjoyed, so she went all out to enjoy it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Whereas you . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>A wry shake of the head, her shoulder-�length hair swinging. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not exactly a party animal. Never have been. But Macy threw herself headfirst into everything. And that . . .&#x201d; Her voice broke. &#x201c;That got her killed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How so?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She invited herself along on my last job for the International Heritage Agency. I could have said no, sent her home. But I didn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t know why, maybe because . . . maybe because I was afraid it might be the last chance I had to spend time with her.&#x201d;<br><br>Elaine flicked back through her notebook. &#x201c;Your illness&#x2014;�you thought it was terminal at that point?&#x201d;<br><br>Nina nodded. She had been under a slow death sentence, poisoned by a toxin from deep within the earth. &#x201c;Yeah. There was a treatment, but I didn&#x2019;t know about it then.&#x201d; She kept the full truth to herself: that the &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; was nothing less than the legendary fountain of immortality sought by Alexander the Great. After the horrors she had been through to find it, she&#x2019;d vowed to keep its location a secret, to prevent the inevitable further bloodshed if others fought to control it. &#x201c;So I let Macy come with us, and . . .&#x201d; She choked up.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you all right?&#x201d; Elaine asked. &#x201c;Do you need a Kleenex or something?&#x201d;<br><br>Nina rubbed away a tear. &#x201c;No, no. I&#x2019;m okay. It&#x2019;s just, talking about it . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I understand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; Nina sat sharply upright, looking Elaine straight in the eye for the first time. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not fair! She was so young, she was practically still a kid! And this man, this bastard, killed her like she was nothing&#x2014;�just to get to me. If I hadn&#x2019;t gotten involved, or if I&#x2019;d done what I should have done and told Macy to go home, she&#x2019;d still be alive! I got her killed!&#x201d;<br><br>She slumped forward, head in her hands, trying to hold in her sobs. Elaine looked on with concern. &#x201c;Nina, I&#x2019;m so, so sorry. But you must know deep down that&#x2019;s not true. You didn&#x2019;t kill your friend. Someone else did.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina forced out a reply. &#x201c;If it weren&#x2019;t for me, she&#x2019;d still be alive. The same goes for Rowan Sharpe, and Jim McCrimmon, and Ismail Assad and Hector Amoros and Chloe Lamb and&#x2014;�and so many others I can&#x2019;t even remember all their names!&#x201d; She looked up in despair. &#x201c;This is what I mean, Elaine. Yes, I made all those discoveries&#x2014;�but this was the cost. Hundreds of people have died because of me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It can&#x2019;t be that many,&#x201d; Elaine said, though with uncertainty.<br><br>&#x201c;Trust me, I was there. My whole career, everything I&#x2019;ve accomplished, has been surrounded by death and destruction. Even when I was still a kid, my parents died&#x2014;�were murdered&#x2014;�while they were hunting for Atlantis. Which is why I&#x2019;ve been asking: Was it all worth it?&#x201d; She looked down at her abdomen, where a small but distinct swelling revealed the presence of her unborn child. &#x201c;Do I want to bring a kid into my world? What right have I got to put a baby at that kind of risk?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re not working for the IHA anymore,&#x201d; Elaine pointed out.<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but you know what?&#x201d; Nina said with another flare of anger. &#x201c;Last month, a Nazi tried to kill me, right here in New York!&#x201d;<br><br>The therapist&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;A . . . Nazi?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, an actual goddamn Nazi. You see? I can&#x2019;t get away from this shit! I tried to, I just wanted to stay out of trouble and write my book, but it keeps finding me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Your book,&#x201d; said Elaine, relieved at a chance to change the subject. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s that going? You told me last time that you&#x2019;d been having difficulty maintaining focus . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Nina huffed sarcastically. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s going super fine, better than ever. No, I&#x2019;m now almost completely blocked. My publishers are gonna be thrilled that they&#x2019;ve paid over half a million dollars for three and a quarter chapters. Some people I know in Hollywood want to buy the screen rights.&#x201d; Macy&#x2019;s boyfriend, the film star Grant Thorn, had unsurprisingly withdrawn from the idea after the young woman&#x2019;s funeral, but his business partner had since made tentative inquiries about reopening negotiations. &#x201c;Right now, though, it&#x2019;d make a really short movie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you blocked?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why? Because every time I start trying to write about what I&#x2019;ve discovered, it makes me think of the people who died in the process. It&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d; She sagged, feeling emotionally drained. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t move forward.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In every way. With my life. All I keep thinking about is whether it&#x2019;s all been worth it, and I don&#x2019;t know the answer, and . . . and I&#x2019;m stuck. Going nowhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you are going somewhere,&#x201d; said Elaine. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve made progress over just the last month&#x2014;�you realized you were in denial over Macy&#x2019;s death, and the fact that you sought help from a therapist shows that you&#x2019;re able to start moving on.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I might be able to start, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean I have started. On that, or anything else. The book&#x2019;s stalled, I can&#x2019;t even do something as simple as come up with baby names . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know the sex?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah. I had an ultrasound last week, and they could tell what it was. My husband, Eddie, told them not to say anything&#x2014;�he wants it to be a surprise&#x2014;�but I sneaked back in and asked. It&#x2019;s a&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>Elaine held up her hands. &#x201c;No, no. I&#x2019;m like your husband, I like surprises too. I didn&#x2019;t know what either of my kids was going to be until they were born.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess I prefer to plan everything in advance. He&#x2019;s more the make-�it-�up-�as-�you-�go type.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So how have things been between you since you learned you were pregnant? Has he been showing any tension, or . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no.&#x201d; Nina shook her head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been great&#x2014;�he&#x2019;s absolutely thrilled at the prospect of having a kid, and he&#x2019;s been doing everything he can to help me. No, it&#x2019;s . . . it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; She sighed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m angry, I&#x2019;m depressed, I&#x2019;m confused&#x2014;�I&#x2019;m a hundred and one negative things, and I&#x2019;m taking all of them out on him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because there isn&#x2019;t anyone else. Since I left the IHA, it&#x2019;s just been me and him. I&#x2019;ve been horrible, and I know it, but . . . but I can&#x2019;t help it.&#x201d;<br><br>A sympathetic nod. &#x201c;Pregnancy hormones can really affect your mood. It&#x2019;s often a lot harder with a first pregnancy, because you don&#x2019;t know what to expect. It&#x2019;s good that he&#x2019;s been so supportive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe, but . . .&#x201d; A lengthy pause as she struggled to make a terrible admission. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help thinking that he&#x2019;s putting up with it for the baby rather than for me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But do you really believe that, Nina? Deep down, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t know what I believe about anything right now.&#x201d; She stared back at the marks on the carpet.<br><br>The therapist made more notes before speaking again. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know your husband, but from what you&#x2019;ve told me, it certainly seems that he loves you. He wants to help you, but you&#x2019;re reluctant to allow it. That&#x2019;s understandable&#x2014;�you&#x2019;ve been through a traumatic experience, and you&#x2019;ve put up barriers to protect yourself from further harm. The problem is that you&#x2019;re not letting anyone through them, even the person who cares about you the most.&#x201d;<br><br>Nina managed a sarcastic grin. &#x201c;Well, duh. I didn&#x2019;t need a psychiatrist to figure that out. I need one to tell me how to deal with it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you to do anything, Nina. I can suggest, and advise, but in the end only you can come up with the answer. Although one thing I would suggest is couples therapy. If you both came in together, we could address some of these issues.&#x201d;<br><br>Another mocking little smile. &#x201c;Eddie seeing a shrink? I can&#x2019;t imagine that ever happening. He has his own ways of dealing with things . . .&#x201d;<br><br>���<br><br>The helicopter dived toward the Statue of Liberty. Eddie Chase gripped the controls, trying to regain height&#x2014;�<br><br>&#x201c;Little advice, Eddie? Remember that thing I showed you called the stick? You might wanna pull it back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh. Yeah.&#x201d; Grimacing, Eddie brought the cyclic control joystick toward him. The Bell 206L LongRanger&#x2019;s nose came up, and the aircraft unsteadily leveled out. &#x201c;That okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t crash into Lady Liberty&#x2019;s face, so yeah. But we oughta go back out over open water. I&#x2019;m havin&#x2019; some bad flashbacks to when I first met you!&#x201d; Harvey Zampelli took the controls, bringing the red, white, and blue helicopter around across the great expanse of New York Bay. The spires of Manhattan rolled into view as he notified air traffic control of his course.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s only my second lesson,&#x201d; said the stocky, balding Yorkshireman once the exchange in his headphones had concluded. &#x201c;And I haven&#x2019;t crashed it yet, so I&#x2019;m not doing too bad.&#x201d;<br><br>Harvey quickly touched the cross hanging from his neck on a chunky gold chain. &#x201c;Jeez, don&#x2019;t say things like that! It&#x2019;s bad luck.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie decided not to tell him how many plane crashes he&#x2019;d been involved in. &#x201c;Thanks again for letting me do this,&#x201d; he said instead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been meaning to learn to fly for ages.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, no problem,&#x201d; the black-�haired pilot replied. &#x201c;I mean, jeez, you saved my life! That&#x2019;s gotta be worth the price of some avgas. I sure as hell hope so, anyway! Right? Right?&#x201d; He laughed, then added, with a hint of insecurity: &#x201c;Right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right,&#x201d; Eddie told him with a grin that revealed the gap between his front teeth. &#x201c;But it&#x2019;s not a problem for you, is it? Doing this in the middle of the day, I mean.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nah, I had an empty slot, and if there ain&#x2019;t any paying customers, I gotta leave her sitting on the pad with the engine running anyway.&#x201d; The LongRanger&#x2019;s flight had begun from the heliport at Manhattan&#x2019;s southern tip; Harvey&#x2019;s aircraft was one of the many offering tourist tours around New York.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t that expensive?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not as expensive as having to do a full check every time I shut down and restart the engine. Quicker too. Besides, I&#x2019;m a pilot. Any chance to fly, I&#x2019;m gonna take it!&#x201d; He laughed again, then surveyed the surrounding airspace. &#x201c;Okay, take the controls. Remember what I told you&#x2014;�keep the cyclic tipped forward to maintain airspeed, but don&#x2019;t push it too far or we&#x2019;ll lose height. We wanna stay between a thousand and fifteen hundred feet. Got it?&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie checked the altimeter, then closed his hands around the two control sticks. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br><br>Harvey raised his own hands. &#x201c;Okay, all yours.&#x201d;<br><br>The Englishman gingerly edged the cyclic forward. He had flown as a passenger in numerous helicopters during his military career with the elite Special Air Service, and in many more since, but his only attempts to fly an aircraft himself had been when the pilot was incapacitated or dead. Which, he mused, had happened alarmingly often.<br><br>Today nobody was trying to kill him. Operating a chopper even in peaceful conditions was still tricky, however. The Bell twitched and squirmed with every shift in the wind, and the fuselage felt as if it were swinging from the rotor hub like a hanging basket. But he held it steady, making slight adjustments to balance the airspeed indicator and altimeter.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing fine,&#x201d; said Harvey. &#x201c;Okay, we&#x2019;re gonna follow the land.&#x201d; He indicated the shores of New Jersey and Staten Island. &#x201c;Use the pedals like I showed you before, real easy.&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie carefully depressed one of the anti-�torque pedals, adjusting the power being fed to the tail rotor. The helicopter slowly turned. &#x201c;That okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s great&#x2014;�whoa, hold on.&#x201d; A new voice came through Eddie&#x2019;s headphones: one of the heliport&#x2019;s staff, telling Harvey that he had a phone call. &#x201c;Eddie, I gotta take this. Just keep doing what you&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br><br>The Englishman gave him an okay as the call came through. &#x201c;Lena, hey hey!&#x201d; said Harvey, his Bronx accent becoming even more rapid-�fire. &#x201c;How you doin&#x2019;? Great night last night, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>Eddie tried not to be distracted by what very quickly became a personal conversation, concentrating on following the shoreline. The huge jetties of the New Jersey container terminal rolled by. He glanced down at them, only to realize with alarm when he looked back at the instruments that the altimeter was falling toward the thousand-�foot mark. He moved the cyclic, but the descent continued. &#x201c;Oh bollocks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Babe, I gotta call you back,&#x201d; said Harvey over the hea...</p><h2>Adoptive Youth Ministry: Integrating Emerging Generations into the Family of Faith (Youth, Family, and Culture)</h2><p>Kids desperately need healthy, committed adults who can help them thrive in their faith and become active participants in the life of the church.

Ember</b> started at Antioch College as a chemistry major. She began taking social science courses because some were required, but she soon found herself intrigued. There were lots of questions without answers, and she became excited about the possibility of a research career in social science. She spent a year in graduate school at Cornell studying sociology before continuing on to Harvard, where she studied anthropology primarily with John and Beatrice Whiting.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For her Ph.D. dissertation she worked among the Luo of Kenya. While there she noticed that many boys were assigned &#x201c;girls&#x2019; work,&#x201d; such as babysitting and household chores, because their mothers (who did most of the agriculture) did not have enough girls to help out. She decided to study the possible effects of task assignment on the social behavior of boys. Using systematic behavior observations, she compared girls, boys who did a great deal of girls&#x2019; work, and boys who did little such work. She found that boys assigned girls&#x2019; work were intermediate in many social behaviors, compared with the other boys and girls. Later, she did cross-cultural research on variation in marriage, family, descent groups, and war and peace, mainly in collaboration with Melvin Ember, whom she married in 1970. All of these cross-cultural studies tested theories on data for worldwide samples of societies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>From 1970 to 1996, she taught at Hunter College of the City University of New York. She has served as president of the Society of Cross-Cultural Research and was one of the directors of the Summer Institutes in Comparative Anthropological Research, which were funded by the National Science Foundation. From 1996 until 2009 she served as executive director of the Human Relations Area Files, Inc. (HRAF), a nonprofit research agency at Yale University. She was appointed President of HRAF in 2010. She is also currently Past-President of the Society for Anthropological Sciences. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After graduating from Columbia College, <b>Melvin Ember</b> went to Yale University for his Ph.D. His mentor at Yale was George Peter Murdock, an anthropologist who was instrumental in promoting cross-cultural research and building a full-text database on the cultures of the world to facilitate cross-cultural hypothesis testing. This database came to be known as the Human Relations Area Files (HRAF) because it was originally sponsored by the Institute of Human Relations at Yale. Growing in annual installments and now distributed in electronic format, the HRAF database currently covers more than 410 cultures, past and present, all over the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Melvin Ember did fieldwork for his dissertation in American Samoa, where he conducted a comparison of three villages to study the effects of commercialization on political life. In addition, he did research on descent groups and how they changed with the increase of buying and selling. His cross-cultural studies focused originally on variation in marital residence and descent groups. He has also done cross-cultural research on the relationship between economic and political development, the origin and extension of the incest taboo, the causes of polygyny, and how archaeological correlates of social customs can help us draw inferences about the past.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>After four years of research at the National Institute of Mental Health, he taught at Antioch College and then Hunter College of the City University of New York. He has served as president of the Society for Cross-Cultural Research. From 1987 until his death in 2009, he was president of HRAF. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Peter N. Peregrine</b> came to anthropology after completing an undergraduate degree in English. He found anthropology&#x2019;s social scientific approach to understanding humans more appealing than the humanistic approach he had learned as an English major. He undertook an ethnohistorical study of the relationship between Jesuit missionaries and Native American peoples for his master&#x2019;s degree and realized that he needed to study archaeology to understand the cultural interactions experienced by Native Americans prior to contact with the Jesuits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While working on his PhD at Purdue University, Peter Peregrine did research on the prehistoric Mississippian cultures of the eastern United States. He found that interactions between groups were common and had been shaping Native American cultures for centuries. Native Americans approached contact with the Jesuits simply as another in a long string of intercultural exchanges. He also found that relatively little research had been done on Native American interactions and decided that comparative research was a good place to begin examining the topic. In 1990, he participated in the Summer Institute in Comparative Anthropological Research, where he met Carol R.

The ideas and issues typically covered in introductory courses are presented here in a remarkably accessible and enjoyable manner. The author demonstrates that serious philosophical inquiry may be perplexing but is ultimately enlightening and liberating.</p><p></p><h2>Smiling Through the Cultural Catastrophe: Toward the Revival of Higher Education</h2><p>Although the essential books of Western civilization are no longer central in our courses or in our thoughts, they retain their ability to energize us intellectually, says Jeffrey Hart in this powerful book. He now presents a guide to some of these literary works, tracing the main currents of Western culture for all who wish to understand the roots of their civilization and the basis for its achievements. Hart focuses on the productive tension between the classical and biblical strains in our civilization-- between a life based on cognition and one based on faith and piety. He begins with the Iliad and Exodus, linking Achilles and Moses as Bronze Age heroic figures. Closely analyzing texts and illuminating them in unexpected ways, he moves on to Socrates and Jesus, who &#34;internalized the heroic,&#34; continues with Paul and Augustine and their Christian synthesis, addresses Dante, Shakespeare (Hamlet), Moli�re, and Voltaire, and concludes with the novel as represented by Crime and Punishment and The Great Gatsby. Hart maintains that the dialectical tensions suggested by this survey account for the restlessness and singular achievements of the West and that the essential books can provide the substance and energy currently missed by both students and educated readers.</p><p>Jeffrey Hart is professor of English emeritus at Dartmouth College. The author of many books, he is also senior editor for the National Review.Not all academics are riding the wave of multiculturalism. Hart, professor emeritus at Dartmouth, stubbornly holds out for the primacy of Western culture. To justify his intransigence, he invokes the distinctively Western tension between Athens and Jerusalem, between rationality and faith, which has fostered in Western culture an artistic and political dynamism found nowhere else. Wearing his erudition with the ease of a senior scholar, Hart first establishes how the dialectic between the classical and biblical strains of Western culture began, Achilles' wrath against the Trojans answering to Moses' defiance of the Egyptians. He then plumbs the imaginative significance of this dialectic in Western literature, from Augustine's <i>Confessions </i>to Fitzgerald's <i>Great Gatsby</i>. Though daring in its sweep, Hart's synthesis leads readers not toward new and original insights, but rather back to valuable old ones, now catastrophically neglected. In predicting that academe will soon shake off the ideologies regnant since the 1960s, Hart may be indulging in wishful thinking. But if his prediction does prove correct, no book will offer more help in guiding the project of cultural reclamation. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It was Charles Darwin&#39;s brilliant discovery that put the lie to these arguments. But only Richard Dawkins could have written this eloquent riposte to the creationists. Natural selection - the unconscious, automatic, blind, yet essentially nonrandom process that Darwin discovered - has no purpose in mind. If it can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, it is the blind watchmaker. Acclaimed as perhaps the most influential work on evolution written in this century, The Blind Watchmaker offers an engaging and accessible introduction to one of the most important scientific discoveries of all time.Richard Dawkins taught zoology at the University of California at Berkeley and at Oxford University and is now the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position he has held since 1995. Among his previous books are The Ancestor&#39;s Tale, The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, Climbing Mount Improbable, Unweaving the Rainbow, and A Devil&#39;s Chaplain. Dawkins lives in Oxford with his wife, the actress and artist Lalla Ward.</p><h2>The Law of Journalism and Mass Communication (Sixth Edition)</h2><p><strong>The Law of Journalism and Mass Communication, Sixth Edition</strong>, by Robert Trager, Susan Dente Ross, and Amy Reynolds offers a clear and engaging introduction to media law with comprehensive coverage and analysis of key cases for future journalists and media professionals.

In this book, Day writes about all facets of her life. Yet whether describing her visits to her daughter&#39;s farm or the writings of the saints, a common theme emerges, namely, the gifts of God&#39;s love and our need to respond to them with personal and social transformation. The concerns of the Catholic Worker movement are no less vital in our day: the disenfranchised poor, the benefits of the meaningful work, the significance of family, the dangers of increasing commercialism and secularism, the decline of moral standards, and the importance of faith. Available for the first time since it was originally published, this edition includes a foreword by Michael O. Garvey and an introduction by Mark and Louise Zwick that gives an overview of Day&#39;s early life and her commitment to the Catholic worker movement.</p><p>Peter Day was born in Australia and educated at Sydney and Queensland universities before moving to England.

Iconic works by Church, Cole, Cropsey, Durand, and others are examined in relation to the religious, moral, and aestethic sensibility that underlies them.</p><p>James F. Cooper is Director of the Cultural Studies Center of The Newington-Cropsey Foundation, a nonprofit educational and scholarly resource for American art; and an editor of American Arts Quarterly.In these days of sensationalism, the images of the past often seem shadowy and rather vague. This work explores a period in American art and culture when both were infused with a strong sense of righteousness and the certainty that the artist must celebrate nature and the deity. The chapter headings--from "Seeing" to "Virtue," "Chivalry" to "Christendom"--echo the ideas expressed in the paintings, contrasting with what art critic Cooper sees as a cultural crisis in our times. Unfortunately, this work comes across as preachy and sentimental, perhaps because of the zealous morality of the time it examines. Still, the works of art, gathered from a wide variety of holdings, are an excellent record of a splendid age of landscape, and Cooper should be commended for preserving and evaluating these important records of a past era. One could only wish that the sense of moral judgment did not overwhelm the critical eye.

Rich was both a gifted colleague and a valued friend who will be greatly missed. We extend our sympathies to his family. </p> <p> Obituary from the <i>Arizona Daily Star</i>: </p> <blockquote> <b>STEVENS, W. Richard</b>, noted author of computer books died on September 1. He is best known for his "UNIX Network Programming" series (1990, 1998, 1999), "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment" (1992), and "TCP/IP Illustrated" series (1994, 1995, 1996). Richard was born in 1951 in Luanshya, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where his father worked for the copper industry. The family moved to Salt Lake City, Hurley, New Mexico, Washington, DC and Phalaborwa, South Africa. Richard attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia. He received a B.SC. in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Michigan in 1973, and an M.S. (1978) and Ph.D. (1982) in Systems Engineering from the University of Arizona. He moved to Tucson in 1975 and from then until 1982 he was employed at Kitt Peak National Observatory as a computer programmer. From 1982 until 1990 he was Vice President of Computing Services at Health Systems International in New Haven, CT, moving back to Tucson in 1990. Here he pursued his career as an author and consultant. He was also an avid pilot and a part-time flight instructor during the 1970's.<p> He is survived by his loving wife of 20 years, Sally Hodges Stevens; three wonderful children, Bill, Ellen and David; sister, Claire Stevens of Las Vegas, NV; brother, Bob and wife Linda Stevens of Dallas, TX; nieces, Laura, Sarah, Collette, Christy; and nephew, Brad. He is predeceased by his parents, Royale J. Stevens (1915-1984); and Helen Patterson Stevens (1916-1997). Helen lived in Tucson from 1991-1997, and Royale lived here in the early 1930's attending Tucson High School while his father was treated for TB at the Desert Sanitorium (now TMC). The family asks that in lieu of flowers, donations be made in Richard's name to Habitat for Humanity, 2950 E. 22nd Street, Tucson, AZ 85713. A memorial service for Richard will be held at St. Phillip's in the Hills Episcopal Church on Tuesday, September 7th at 12:00 noon. Following the service there will be a reception in the Murphy Gallery of the Church. Please wear colorful clothing to the service; Richard loved colors.</p></blockquote> <p> <b>W. Richard Stevens</b> was an acknowledged UNIX and networking expert and the highly-respected author of several books. He was also a sought-after instructor and consultant.</p> <p> <b>Stephen A. Rago</b>, one of the Bell Laboratories developers who built UNIX System V, Release 4, currently works as a manger at EMC, specializing in file servers and file systems.</p> <br> <br><p><b>Introduction </b></p> <p>Rich Stevens and I first met through an e-mail exchange when I reported a typographical error in his first book, <i>UNIX Network Programming</i>. He used to kid me about being the person to send him his first errata notice for the book. Until his death in 1999, we exchanged e-mail irregularly, usually when one of us had a question we thought the other might be able to answer. We met for dinner at USENIX conferences and when Rich was teaching in the area. </p> <p>Rich Stevens was a friend who always conducted himself as a gentleman. When I wrote <i>UNIX System V Network Programming</i> in 1993, I intended it to be a System V version of Rich's <i>UNIX Network Programming</i>. As was his nature, Rich gladly reviewed chapters for me, and treated me not as a competitor, but as a colleague. We often talked about collaborating on a STREAMS version of his <i>TCP/IP Illustrated</i> book. Had events been different, we might have actually done it, but since Rich is no longer with us, revising <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i> is the closest I'll ever get to writing a book with him. </p> <p>When the editors at Addison-Wesley told me that they wanted to update Rich's book, I thought that there wouldn't be too much to change. Even after 13 years, Rich's work still holds up well. But the UNIX industry is vastly different today from what it was when the book was first published.</p> <ul> <li>The System V variants are slowly being replaced by Linux. The major system vendors that ship their hardware with their own versions of the UNIX System have either made Linux ports available or announced support for Linux. Solaris is perhaps the last descendant of UNIX System V Release 4 with any appreciable market share. </li> <li>After 4.4BSD was released, the Computing Science Research Group (CSRG) from the University of California at Berkeley decided to put an end to its development of the UNIX operating system, but several different groups of volunteers still maintain publicly available versions. </li> <li>The introduction of Linux, supported by thousands of volunteers, has made it possible for anyone with a computer to run an operating system similar to the UNIX System, with freely available source code for the newest hardware devices. The success of Linux is something of a curiosity, given that several free BSD alternatives are readily available. </li> <li>Continuing its trend as an innovative company, Apple Computer abandoned its old Mac operating system and replaced it with one based on Mach and FreeBSD. </li> </ul> <p>Thus, I've tried to update the information presented in this book to reflect these four platforms. </p> <p>After Rich wrote <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i> in 1992, I got rid of most of my UNIX programmer 's manuals. To this day, the two books I keep closest to my desk are a dictionary and a copy of <i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i>. I hope you find this revision equally useful. </p> <p><b>Changes from the First Edition</b></p> <p>Rich's work holds up well. I've tried not to change his original vision for this book, but a lot has happened in 13 years. This is especially true with the standards that affect the UNIX programming interface. </p> <p>Throughout the book, I've updated interfaces that have changed from the ongoing efforts in standards organizations. This is most noticeable in Chapter 2, since its primary topic is standards. The 2001 version of the POSIX.1 standard, which we use in this revision, is much more comprehensive than the 1990 version on which the first edition of this book was based. The 1990 ISO C standard was updated in 1999, and some changes affect the interfaces in the POSIX.1 standard. </p> <p>A lot more interfaces are now covered by the POSIX.1 specification. The base specifications of the Single UNIX Specification (published by The Open Group, formerly X/Open) have been merged with POSIX.1. POSIX.1 now includes several 1003.1 standards and draft standards that were formerly published separately. Accordingly, I've added chapters to cover some new topics. Threads and multithreaded programming are important concepts because they present a cleaner way for programmers to deal with concurrency and asynchrony. </p> <p>The socket interface is now part of POSIX.1. It provides a single interface to interprocess communication (IPC), regardless of the location of the process, and is a natural extension of the IPC chapters.</p> <p>I've omitted most of the real-time interfaces that appear in POSIX.1. These are best treated in a text devoted to real-time programming. One such book appears in the bibliography. </p> <p>I've updated the case studies in the last chapters to cover more relevant real-world examples. For example, few systems these days are connected to a PostScript printer via a serial or parallel port. Most PostScript printers today are accessed via a network, so I've changed the case study that deals with PostScript printer communication to take this into account.</p> <p>The chapter on modem communication is less relevant these days. So that the original material is not lost, however, it is available on the book's Web site in two formats: PostScript (http://www.apuebook.com/lostchapter/modem.ps) and PDF (http://www.apuebook.com/lostchapter/modem.pdf). </p>The source code for the examples shown in this book is also available at www.apuebook.com. Most of the examples have been run on four platforms: <ol> <li>FreeBSD 5.2.1, a derivative of the 4.4BSD release from the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley, running on an Intel Pentium processor </li> <li>Linux 2.4.22 (the Mandrake 9.2 distribution), a free UNIX-like operating system, running on Intel Pentium processors </li> <li>Solaris 9, a derivative of System V Release 4 from Sun Microsystems, running on a64-bit UltraSPARC IIi processor </li> <li>Darwin 7.4.0, an operating environment based on FreeBSD and Mach, supported by Apple Mac OS X, version 10.3, on a PowerPC processor</li> </ol> <p>Stephen A. Rago<br>Warren, New Jersey <br>April 2005 <br> sar@apuebook.com </p> <p><b>Preface to the First Edition</b></p> <p><b>Introduction </b></p> <p>This book describes the programming interface to the Unix system--the system call interface and many of the functions provided in the standard C library. It is intended for anyone writing programs that run under Unix. </p> <p>Like most operating systems, Unix provides numerous services to the programs that are running -- open a file, read a file, start a new program, allocate a region of memory, get the current time-of-day, and so on. This has been termed the system call interface. Additionally, the standard C library provides numerous functions that are used by almost every C program (format a variable's value for output, compare two strings, etc.). </p> <p>The system call interface and the library routines have traditionally been described in Sections 2 and 3 of the Unix Programmer 's Manual. This book is not a duplication of these sections. Examples and rationale are missing from the Unix Programmer 's Manual, and that's what this book provides. </p> <p><b>Unix Standards </b></p> <p>The proliferation of different versions of Unix during the 1980s has been tempered by the various international standards that were started during the late 1980s. These include the ANSI standard for the C programming language, the IEEE POSIX family (still being developed), and the X/Open portability guide. This book also describes these standards. But instead of just describing the standards by themselves, we describe them in relation to popular implementations of the standards -- System V Release 4 and the forthcoming 4.4BSD. This provides a real-world description, which is often lacking from the standard itself and from books that describe only the standard. </p> <p><b>Organization of the Book </b></p> <p>This book is divided into six parts: </p>An overview and introduction to basic Unix programming concepts and terminology (Chapter 1), with a discussion of the various Unix standardization efforts and different Unix implementations (Chapter 2). <ol> <li>I/O--unbuffered I/O (Chapter 3), properties of files and directories (Chapter 4), the standard I/O library (Chapter 5), and the standard system data files (Chapter 6). </li> <li>Processes -- the environment of a Unix process (Chapter 7), process control (Chapter 8), the relationships between different processes (Chapter 9), and signals (Chapter 10). </li> <li>More I/O -- terminal I/O (Chapter 11), advanced I/O (Chapter 12), and daemon processes (Chapter 13). </li> <li>IPC--Interprocess communication (Chapters 14 and 15). </li> <li>Examples--a database library (Chapter 16), communicating with a PostScript printer (Chapter 17), a modem dialing program (Chapter 18), and using pseudo terminals (Chapter 19). </li> </ol> <p>A reading familiarity with C would be beneficial as would some experience using Unix. No prior programming experience with Unix is assumed. This text is intended for programmers familiar with Unix and programmers familiar with some other operating system who wish to learn the details of the services provided by most Unix systems. </p> <p><b>Examples in the Text </b></p> <p>This book contains many examples--approximately 10,000 lines of source code. All the examples are in the C programming language. Furthermore, these examples are in ANSI C. You should have a copy of the Unix Programmer's Manual for your system handy while reading this book, since reference is made to it for some of the more esoteric and implementation-dependent features. </p> <p>Almost every function and system call is demonstrated with a small, complete program. This lets us see the arguments and return values and is often easier to comprehend than the use of the function in a much larger program. But since some of the small programs are contrived examples, a few bigger examples are also included (Chapters 16, 17, 18, and 19). These larger examples demonstrate the programming techniques in larger, real-world examples.</p> <p><b>Systems Used to Test the Examples </b></p> <p>Unfortunately all operating systems are moving targets. Unix is no exception. The following diagram shows the recent evolution of the various versions of System V and 4.xBSD.</p> <p>4.xBSD are the various systems from the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California at Berkeley. This group also distributes the BSD Net 1 and BSD Net 2 releases -- publicly available source code from the 4.xBSD systems. SVRx refers to System V Release x from AT&amp;T. XPG3 is the X/Open Portability Guide, Issue 3, and ANSI C is the ANSI standard for the C programming language. POSIX.1 is the IEEE and ISO standard for the interface to a Unix-like system. We'll have more to say about these different standards and the various versions of Unix in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. </p> <p>In this text we use the term 4.3+BSDto refer to the Unix system from Berkeley that is somewhere between the BSD Net 2 release and 4.4BSD. At the time of this writing, 4.4BSD was not released, so the system could not be called 4.4BSD.

Among the guests of the hotel is Doctor Otternschlag, a World War I veteran whose face has been sliced in half by a shell. Day after day he emerges to read the paper in the lobby, discreetly inquiring at the desk if the letter he&#x2019;s been awaiting for years has arrived. Then there is Grusinskaya, a great ballerina now fighting a losing battle not so much against age as against her fear of it, who may or may not be made for Gaigern, a sleek professional thief. Herr Preysing also checks in, the director of a family firm that isn&#x2019;t as flourishing as it appears, who would never imagine that Kringelein, his underling, a timorous petty clerk he&#x2019;s bullied for years, has also come to Berlin, determined to live at last now that he&#x2019;s received a medical death sentence. All these characters and more, with all their secrets and aspirations, come together and come alive in the pages of Baum&#x2019;s delicious and&nbsp;disturbing masterpiece.</p><p><b>Vicki Baum </b>(1888&#x2013;1960) was born into an affluent Jewish family in Vienna. Her childhood was dominated by a depressed mother and an authoritarian, hypochondriac father, who discouraged her early forays into literature. She studied harp at the Vienna Academy for Music and the Performing Arts and left home at eighteen to marry Max Prels, a journalist under whose name her first short stories were published. In 1916, after the dissolution of her first marriage, she married the conductor Richard Lert and launched her literary career, eventually writing nearly a book a year while working as an editor at the German publishing house Ullstein. Her first major success came in 1920 with the publication of her second novel, <i>Once in Vienna</i>. She spent several months in New York and Hollywood during the making of the film adaptation of <i>Grand Hotel</i>&#x2014;which starred Greta Garbo and Joan Crawford and went on to win the 1933 Oscar for Best Film&#x2014;and, before Hitler&#x2019;s rise to power, resettled in Los Angeles, where she continued to publish novels while also working as a screenwriter for Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Her memoir, <i>It Was All Quite Different</i>, was published posthumously.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>Basil Creighton</b> (1886&#x2013;1989) translated many notable works of German literature, including Hermann Hesse&#x2019;s <i>Steppenwolf</i>, B. Traven&#x2019;s <i>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</i>, and Alma Mahler&#x2019;s <i>Gustav Mahler: Memories and Letters.</i><br><br> <b>Margot Bettauer Dembo</b> has translated works by Judith Hermann, Robert Gernhardt, Joachim Fest, �d�n von Horv�th, and Feridun Zaimoglu, among others. She was awarded the Goethe-Institut/Berlin Translator&#x2019;s Prize in 1994 and the Helen and Kurt Wolff Translator&#x2019;s Prize in 2003. Dembo has also worked as a translator for two feature documentary films: <i>The Restless Conscience</i>, which was nominated for an Academy Award, and <i>The Burning Wall</i>. Her translation of <i>Transit</i> by Anna Seghers was published by NYRB Classics in 2013.<br><br> <b>Noah Isenberg</b> is a professor of culture and media at the New School, where he also serves as the director of screen studies.

Isenberg is a fellow at the New York Institute for the Humanities and the recipient of a 2015 NEH Public Scholar award."The legacy of Baum's novel is not just the 1932 MGM film starring John Barrymore and Greta Garbo (and the 1980s Broadway musical), but all those star-stuffed movies and fat popular novels...in which some institution or event serves as the setting for the intersecting individual dramas. What distinguishes the book from its plump progeny is not only its relatively modest length but the delicacy of Baum's writing...The book is kin to both the stories of Stefan Zweig and the films of Max Oph�ls, both artists who chronicled devastating loss but drew our eye to the exquisite fluidity with which the most precious things slid through their characters' elegant, manicured fingers.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Kirkus&nbsp;</i>starred review<br><br>&#x201c;Through the revolving doors of <i>Grand Hotel</i> pass multifarious stray souls: some resigned to their drab fates, others searching eagerly for life&#x2014;all persuaded that it has somehow passed them by.&nbsp; We meet them as they come under the practiced eye of the staff, expert in Weimar Berlin&#x2019;s taxonomies of class. Like George Grosz, Vicki Baum renders human foibles at their most pathetic, despicable, and comical, then turns her characters inside out, until we recognize our own hopes and fears refracted in them.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Holly Brubach<br><br>"The author's strength is creating compelling characters with sexual attitudes that feel contemporary. <i>Grand Hotel</i> prefigures <i>Downtown Abbey</i> and <i>Upstairs, Downstairs</i> by examining multiple characters from different classes (both guests and the hotel staff) in a single-setting microcosm of society and lives up to its reputation as a modern classic." &#x2014;Kevin Howell, <i>Shelf Awareness&nbsp;</i><br><br> &#x201c;A spiritual motion picture of modern life, the characteristics, the cross-currents of thought and emotion, of this new age.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;J.

Notorious as the scourge of Mormon transgressors, the stranger stays on to assist in the inevitable showdown, and romance blooms amid the canyons and cottonwoods.

It is the story of Lassiter, a gunslinging avenger in black, who shows up in a remote Utah town just in time to save the young and beautiful rancher Jane Withersteen from having to marry a Mormon elder against her will. Lassiter is on his own quest, one that ends when he discovers a secret grave on Jane&#39;s grounds. &#34;[Zane Grey&#39;s] popularity was neither accidental nor undeserved,&#34; wrote Nye. &#34;Few popular novelists have possessed such a grasp of what the public wanted and few have developed Grey&#39;s skill at supplying it.&#34;</p><h2>Gore Capitalism (Semiotext(e) / Intervention Series)</h2><p><p><b>An analysis of contemporary violence as the new commodity of today's hyper-consumerist stage of capitalism.</b></p><p>&#x201c;Death has become the most profitable business in existence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;from <i>Gore Capitalism</i></p><p>Written by the Tijuana activist intellectual Sayak Valencia, <i>Gore Capitalism</i> is a crucial essay that posits a decolonial, feminist philosophical approach to the outbreak of violence in Mexico and, more broadly, across the global regions of the Third World. Valencia argues that violence itself has become a product within hyper-consumerist neoliberal capitalism, and that tortured and mutilated bodies have become commodities to be traded and utilized for profit in an age of impunity and governmental austerity.</p><p>In a lucid and transgressive voice, Valencia unravels the workings of the politics of death in the context of contemporary networks of hyper-consumption, the ups and downs of capital markets, drug trafficking, narcopower, and the impunity of the neoliberal state. She looks at the global rise of authoritarian governments, the erosion of civil society, the increasing violence against women, the deterioration of human rights, and the transformation of certain cities and regions into depopulated, ghostly settings for war. She offers a trenchant critique of masculinity and gender constructions in Mexico, linking their misogynist force to the booming trade in violence.</p><p>This book is essential reading for anyone seeking to analyze the new landscapes of war.

Lyrical and pungent, passionate and polemical, this volume is a treasure-an essential collection of the work of a poet whose words have entered our common language.</p><p><b>Langston Hughes</b> was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 1902. After graduation from high school, he spent a year in Mexico with his father, then a year studying at Columbia University. His first poem in a nationally known magazine was <b>"The Negro Speaks of Rivers,"</b> which appeared in Crisis in 1921. In 1925, he was awarded the First Prize for Poetry of the magazine Opportunity, the winning poem being <b>"The Weary Blues,"</b> which gave its title to his first book of poems, published in 1926. As a result of his poetry, Mr. Hughes received a scholarship at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he won his B.A. in 1929. In 1943, he was awarded an honorary Litt.D. by his alma mater; he has also been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1935), a Rosenwald Fellowship (1940), and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Grant (1947). From 1926 until his death in 1967, Langston Hughes devoted his time to writing and lecturing. He wrote poetry, short stories, autobiography, song lyrics, essays, humor, and plays.

Until now, they have been considered completely irreconcilable theories of origin and existence. David Sloan Wilson's <i>Darwin's Cathedral</i> takes the radical step of joining the two, in the process proposing an evolutionary theory of religion that shakes both evolutionary biology and social theory at their foundations.<br><br>The key, argues Wilson, is to think of society as an organism, an old idea that has received new life based on recent developments in evolutionary biology. If society is an organism, can we then think of morality and religion as biologically and culturally evolved adaptations that enable human groups to function as single units rather than mere collections of individuals? Wilson brings a variety of evidence to bear on this question, from both the biological and social sciences. From Calvinism in sixteenth-century Geneva to Balinese water temples, from hunter-gatherer societies to urban America, Wilson demonstrates how religions have enabled people to achieve by collective action what they never could do alone. He also includes a chapter considering forgiveness from an evolutionary perspective and concludes by discussing how all social organizations, including science, could benefit by incorporating elements of religion.<br><br>Religious believers often compare their communities to single organisms and even to insect colonies. Astoundingly, Wilson shows that they might be literally correct. Intended for any educated reader, <i>Darwin's Cathedral</i> will change forever the way we view the relations among evolution, religion, and human society.</p><p>God or evolution? Though the debate about our origins has swirled in epic controversy since Darwin's time, David Sloan Wilson bravely blends these two contentious theories. This has been tried before, of course, mainly by religious intellectuals. What makes <i>Darwin's Cathedral</i> stand out is that Wilson does not pursue the classic "intelligent design" argument (evolution is God's hand at work), but instead argues that religion is evolution at work. <p> Wilson sees religion as a complex organism with "biological" functions. He argues that the social cohesiveness of religion makes it analogous to a beehive or a human body--and, in fact, religious believers sometimes employ these metaphors. He writes, "Thinking of a religious group as like an organism encourages us to look for adaptive complexity.... Mechanisms are required that are often awesome in their sophistication." To Wilson, therein lies the astonishing complexity of religion, just as in the biological world. </p><p> Following Wilson's argument requires understanding the rudiments of evolutionary biology; a smattering of theology, history, anthropology, sociology, and psychology is helpful, too. But the reasoning isn't as challenging as Wilson warns in the introduction. For educated readers, it's an accessible book. </p><p> In just 260 pages, Wilson can't begin to do justice to the broad swath of intellectual work he's cut out for himself. And ultimately, the book's main failing is its simplicity. In addition, his approach to religion is so clearly an outsider's that he is unlikely to win many converts. Adaptive-mechanistic explanations of forgiveness and altruism may be intriguing to the atheist in the ivory tower, but they are likely to elicit little more than a bemused and passing interest from believers. <i>--Eric de Place</i></p><b>David Sloan Wilson</b> is a professor of biology and anthropology at Binghamton University.

He also, however, wrote many masterly short stories, and this volume contains four of the longest and best in distinguished translations that have stood the test of time. In the early story 'Family Happiness', Tolstoy explores courtship and marriage from the point of view of a young wife. In 'The Kreutzer Sonata' he gives us a terrifying study of marital breakdown, in 'The Devil' a powerful depiction of the power of sexual temptation, and, in perhaps the finest of all, 'The Death of Ivan Ilyich', he portrays the long agony of a man gradually coming to terms with his own mortality.</p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, December 2009</b>: To anyone for whom Leo Tolstoy's masterpieces <i>War and Peace</i> and <i>Anna Karenina</i> have stood as giants too daunting to scale, and equally to the many readers who have devoured those novels and are hungry for more, we offer <i>The Death of Ivan Ilyich and Other Stories</i>. Newly translated by the team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, who have enlivened the Russian classics for a new generation, this selection of 11 of his finest stories reveals a Tolstoy of many sides and unsurpassed storytelling talents. Along with smaller gems like "Alyosha the Pot," the collection features a handful of thrilling longer tales that each carry the power of a novel: the terrifying murderer's confession of "The Kreuzer Sonata," the breathlessly dramatic path of a single crime through dozens of lives in "The Forged Coupon," and the haunting account of the isolation of mortality in the legendary title story. Most revelatory of all for a modern reader is the final novella, and Tolstoy's final work, "Hadji Murat," the disturbingly contemporary story of a fiercely honorable Chechen warrior caught between local rivalries and the ambivalent reach of a decadent empire. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Leo Tolstoy (1828&#x2013;1910) was a nineteenth-century Russian author whose best-known works include War and Peace and Anna Karenina.</p><h2>Moments of Being: Unpublished autobiographical writings</h2><p>Virginia Woolf's only autobiographical writing is to be found in this collection of five unpublished pieces.

Jung) (Jung Extracts, 33)</h2><p><p>Considered one of Jung's most controversial works, <i>Answer to Job</i> also stands as Jung's most extensive commentary on a biblical text. Here, he confronts the story of the man who challenged God, the man who experienced hell on earth and still did not reject his faith. Job's journey parallels Jung's own experience--as reported in <i>The Red Book: Liber Novus</i>--of descending into the depths of his own unconscious, confronting and reconciling the rejected aspects of his soul.</p><br><p> This paperback edition of Jung's classic work includes a new foreword by Sonu Shamdasani, Philemon Professor of Jung History at University College London. Described by Shamdasani as "the theology behind <i>The Red Book</i>," <i>Answer to Job</i> examines the symbolic role that theological concepts play in an individual's psychic life.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Jung. . . .points out that the psychology of religion has two aspects, the psychology of religious persons and the psychology of religious 'contents.'

The date of his birth is not known but is traditionally 23 April, St George&#39;s Day. Aged 18, he married a Stratford farmer&#39;s daughter, Anne Hathaway. They had three children. Around 1585 William joined an acting troupe on tour in Stratford from London, and thereafter spent much of his life in the capital. A member of the leading theatre group in London, the Chamberlain&#39;s Men, which built the Globe Theatre and frequently performed in front of Queen Elizabeth I, Shakespeare wrote 36 plays and much poetry besides. He died in 1616.</p><h2>Going to Meet the Man</h2><p>&#34;There&#39;s no way not to suffer. But you try all kinds of ways to keep from drowning in it.&#34; The men and women in these eight short fictions grasp this truth on an elemental level, and their stories, as told by James Baldwin, detail the ingenious and often desperate ways in which they try to keep their heads above water. It may be the heroin that a down-and-out jazz pianist uses to face the terror of pouring his life into an inanimate instrument. It may be the brittle piety of a father who can never forgive his son for his illegitimacy. Or it may be the screen of bigotry that a redneck deputy has raised to blunt the awful childhood memory of the day his parents took him to watch a black man being murdered by a gleeful mob.</p><p><p><b>James Baldwin</b> (1924-1987) was educated in New York. His first novel, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, received excellent reviews and was immediately recognized as establishing a profound and permanent new voice in American letters. The appearance of <i>The Fire Next Time</i> in 1963, just as the civil rights movement was exploding across the American South, galvanized the nation and continues to reverberate as perhaps the most prophetic and defining statement ever written of the continuing costs of Americans' refusal to face their own history. It became a national bestseller, and Baldwin was featured on the cover of <i>Time</i>. The next year, he was made a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters and collaborated with the photographer Richard Avedon on <i>Nothing Personal</i>, a series of portraits of America intended as a eulogy for the slain Medger Evers. His other collaborations include <i>A Rap on Race</i> with Margaret Mead and <i>A Dialogue</i> with the poet-activist Nikki Giovanni. He also adapted Alex Haley's <i>The Autobiography of Malcolm X</i> into <i>One Day When I Was Lost</i>. He was made a commander of the French Legion of Honor a year before his death, one honor among many he achieved in his life.</p></p><h2>Three Genres: The Writing of Poetry, Fiction, and Drama (7th Edition)</h2><p>Based on the author's 40 years of teaching experience and extensive publication, this time-tested, <i>hands-on</i> introduction to poetry, fiction, and drama writing addresses the dynamics of the creative process while providing a non-technical analysis of each genre.
